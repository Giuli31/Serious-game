1,"Development of 3D Serious Game: Colorful Classroom to Effectively Teach Children Colors Letters and Numbers","The application of serious games (SGs) has shown significant improvements in the education of both children without disorders and children with disorders such as autism. The major advantage of SGs over the traditional teaching approach is the possibility to boost motivation and engagement of children during the learning process. Currently, formal educational systems of many developed countries integrate SGs into primary and secondary schools. This re-search focuses on developing a 3D game called Colorful Classroom to enable children learn letters of the English alphabet, colors and numbers. The entire concept of the game is established using the Unity Engine, and all 3D models, including classroom and other objects, are modelled from scratch in Maya Autodesk. Evaluation of the game was conducted on two testing samples com-posed of typically developing, mentally delayed and autistic children. The findings show progressive learning of both tested groups and positive feed-back from teachers regarding the game design and logic. Finally, the game described in this research paper could be enhanced by designing more classes in different lessons.",NULL,NULL
2,"Allegation and World-Building in Video Games","This chapter introduces the notion of allegation, as it has been discussed by Polish literary scholars following Giselle Mathieu-Castellanis (Littrature 55:2436, 1984) suggestions, into game analysis. Allegation ( allgation ) can be explained as the intertextual allusion that serves the persuasive function of establishing authority of the text that utilises it. The case studies analysed here are Child of Light (Ubisoft Montreal, Child of Light. PC Game. Steam, 2014) and My Memory of Us (Juggler Games, My Memory of Us. PC Game. Steam. https://store.steampowered.com/app/651500/My_Memory_of_Us/ , 2018). These games share a number of characteristics, which makes it possible to compare and contrast the strategies they use, specifically with respect to the function of allegation as a storyworld-building strategy. Allegation is a relatively unknown term, the reason being most probably that it has not been discussed extensively in the English-speaking academic discourse yet. However, given its medium-neutral character, it might be assumed that while Polish scholars such as Micha Gowiski, Stanisaw Balbus, Henryk Markiewicz, Agnieszka Fuliska, Katarzyna Szalewska, Agata Buda or Pawe Jarnicki have developed the concept for the sake of literary analysis, allegation is also applicable to game studies. Therefore, the aim of this chapter is to change the present situation and introduce the findings of the above mentioned scholars to a broader audience, at the same time suggesting a valuable conceptual tool for formal analysis of video games. The author follows Gowiskis (Pamitnik Literacki 77(4):75100, 1986) decision to translate Castellanis (Littrature 55:2436, 1984) allgation as alegacja and suggests that this term be called allegation , as it has already been by Buda (J. Lang. Cult. Edu. 3(1):25462, 2015). This text develops the authors ideas presented at two conferences (Mochocka, Dialogue or Monologue? Intertextuality as Allegation in Child of Light and My Memory of Us, 2019a; Childrens games and play in My Memory of Us, 2019b), and includes expanded versions of the conference abstracts. Section 1 presents the concept of allegation. Section 2 outlines the major narrative themes in the two games. Section 3 analyses examples of monologic and dialogic allegations in Child of Light and My Memory of Us in the context of the aforementioned themes. The author decided to rely on content analysis, close reading (Fernandez-Vara, Introduction to Game Analysis. Routledge, New York and London, 2014) the relevant components of the games in the process of playing them, with Bogosts (Unit Operations An Approach to Videogame Criticism. The MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England, 2006) unit operations approach in mind. The author tried to select and focus on intertextual allusions that could be understood as allegations present in the game, whether they were to be found in the semiotic substance or the mechanics of the games. The data was collected during repeated game sessions and note taking (approximately 40hours in the case of Child of Light , and 16hours in the case of My Memory of Us ). To secure efficient exploration (Lankoski and Bjrk, Formal analysis of gameplay. In: Lankoski P, Bjrk S (eds.), Game Research Methods. An Overview. ETC Press, Halifax, pp. 2335, 2015), the author used hacks recommended in a selection of sources. Sources such as interviews with the designer team, reviews, and marketing information were used as paratextual materials.",NULL,NULL
3,"Character Design: The Case of Characters in a Hybrid Serious Game Called FlavourGame","FlavourGame is a hybrid board game, from the serious games category, which aims to promote among children, discussion and awareness for taking correct choices in their nutrition. As part of this project, the design of the characters that make up the games narrative is being developed. This process, which is still undergoing, so far involved, in a first stage, a small literature review on the process of Character Design, in order to identify the existence of some kind of transversal methodology to follow. In a second stage, the main psychological and emotional characteristics of the characters were determined, so that, in a third stage, the visual design of these characters was studied. Finally, and in a fourth stage, different components of the Design of the characters were evaluated with three samples of the target audience. Thus, this article presents the theoretical framework connected to character design, describes the so far undergone creative and design process of FlavourGame s characters and presents three small stages of the characters design assessment with children between the ages of 10 to 12. Throughout the article, we also identify and describe the iterations and changes that were made to the character design according to both the opinions expressed by the children regarding their preferences and the collaboration of a graphic designer in the character design process.",NULL,NULL
4,"ARcode: Programming for Youngsters Through AR","Since coding literacy has become a necessity, acquiring the fundamentals of programming at an early stage can bring countless constructive consequences to many aspects of the youngsters lives. Educational serious games have recently attracted attention, especially with the post-pandemic surge in homeschooling and distance learning. The majority of the existing serious games are either using the traditional two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) environments. One of the most emerging technologies over the recent years is Augmented Reality (AR). This study describes the findings of a comparative experimental research that questions the impact of the medium of a serious game on the learning process of Computer Science (CS) core concepts for youngsters. The objective of the experiment is the design, implementation and evaluation of an AR serious game that would assist youngsters in learning the basic programming concepts. This game was developed in order to examine the effectiveness of an engaging AR serious game on the learning process for youngsters compared to another implemented 2D version of the same game, in the context of teaching CS.",NULL,NULL
5,"Gamification for Visualization Applications in the Construction Industry","With the advancement of computer and information technologies in recent years, visualization applications such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) have been applied widely across the architecture, engineering, construction, and operation (AECO) industry. Game features and mechanisms have been integrated with these visualization applications, expanding their impact. The core structure of these gamified applications echoes the essence of serious games (SGs). SGs have been identified as video games with serious purposes rather than pure entertainment, such as education, training, and analysis. With SGs principles, various impacts are expected as an outcome of humancomputer interaction. In the context of the AECO sector, SGs have been applied to construction health and safety education, professional skill training, evacuation training, behavioural analysis, emergency studies, and decision-making processes. This chapter introduces SGs and their theoretical backgrounds, outlines the development principles of SGs tailored to AECO practitioners, discusses the state-of-the-art applications and impacts on the AECO industry, and draws future expectations and potential implications concerning gamification for visualization applications in the Industry 4.0 era.",NULL,NULL
6,"GiroJampa: A Serious Game Prototype for Wheelchairs Rehabilitation","Spinal cord injury is an impairment in the spinal canal, that leads to sensorimotor deficiency, causing dependency by motor impairment, affecting not only the physical aspect, but also the psychoemotional. Serious games are games whose purpose lies beyond entertainment, and they can be applied in a multitude of activities within the health field, including rehabilitation. This works goal is show the results from the development of a serious game prototype. The game was designed to aid in both the motor rehabilitation and the psychoemotional aspects of patients with thoracolumbosacral spinal cord injury, wheelchair users, through a decision-making model that balance difficulty from user performance. The development process was structured in three stages: the first was the elaboration of project step diagram; the second consisted of the games design; and the third consisted of defining the prototype tests. The prototype contains the basic elements of a game, with definition of the scenario and aesthetics, technology, narrative, and definition of the decision-making model, in addition to having a multidisciplinary team to define the priority points for approaching the game, attending to the target audience needs.",NULL,NULL
7,"HiZeca: A Serious Game for Emotions Recognition","To comprehend human behavior can be a very difficult task for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). These children have difficulties in social interaction, and they manifest repetitive patterns. Furthermore, they present deficits in imitation which can be directly linked to impairments in social interaction skills. Taking this into account, this paper presents the serious game HiZeca, in which a virtual agent (ZECA Avatar) is able to interact with a child, in order to promote social interaction and training certain facial movements that will be validated, and that will facilitate imitation and recognition of emotions (content, sad, surprised, among others). In order to validate the system, tests were conducted with typically developing children and children with ASD. The results show that, in general, the game was accepted with a positive feedback from the children.",NULL,NULL
8,"ZeusAR: a process and an architecture to automate the development of augmented reality serious games","A software development process comprises all the steps necessary to produce a software product. This research proposes a new process for developing augmented reality serious games (ARSGs), which comprises three phases: analysis, configuration, and generation. The analysis phase involves examining the standard project structure of a typical serious game to identify the applicable actions to which AR content can be added. The configuration phase involves configuring the AR features and the AR library to be integrated into the game structure. Finally, the generation phase entails inserting the AR code in the game structure, as well as all the files necessary to in-corporate AR features in the game. Our process allows generating ARSGs step by step, both easily and rapidly. To implement this process, we propose an ARSG development software architecture. The underlying assumption of this architecture is that software development tools are essential validation elements of the software generation process. By implementing our ARSG development process through a software architecture, we provide users with a formal, automated method for creating ARSGs. The ARSG development process and the architecture, collectively called ZeusAR, are not dependent on specific software development technologies and/or programming languages. To perform a proof-of-concept of our process, we developed an ARSG generator tool based on the proposed architecture and conducted a case study in which geometry ARSGs are developed to help high school students learn about geometric shapes and their properties. We conducted a qualitative evaluation of the ZeusAR tool through a System-Usability-Scale (SUS) based survey, which was administered to a group of geometry teachers to evaluate the tools characteristics, such as ease of use and ease of configuration. Additionally, a group of software developers and professors assessed the performance of the ZeusAR tool in terms of game development time.",NULL,NULL
9,"Comparison of binocular game and patching in treating mild to moderate anisometropic amblyopia: a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial","Background Amblyopia, as a neurodevelopmental preventable visual disorder, affects approximately 1.1 % in Asia. A binocular approach to treating amblyopia has been recently proposed. Whether the binocular playing game treatment is comparable to patching treatment needs further randomized clinical trials. To address this, the present research, designs, develops, and evaluates a new binocular game to treat amblyopia. Methods This study has been designed as a non-inferiority, randomized, two parallel-group, controlled trial. Forty-four patients between 4 and 12years diagnosed with amblyopia will be randomly assigned to the control and intervention groups. In the intervention group, amblyopia treatment is provided with red-green anaglyphic glasses and a red filter placed in front of the amblyopic eye, along with a game to be played for 30min twice a day. Those in the control group will receive patch therapy according to amblyopia treatment study protocol. The primary outcome is to change visual acuity in the amblyopic eye from the baseline to 3months after randomization.

10,"Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a serious game targeting interpersonal emotion regulation in early adolescents","Background Adaptive interpersonal emotion regulation (iER) is a vital tool for positive relations. During early adolescence, peer relations become increasingly important, making this age group a relevant target group for interventions promoting positive interactions with each other, yet no evidence-based intervention exists for iER andearly adolescents specifically. Methods This randomised controlled trial (RCT) aims to test effectiveness and feasibility of a serious game training iER skills in early adolescents by comparing outcomes with a control group playing a game without psychoeducational content in a pre- and post-test design. German- and English-speaking early adolescents (1014years) are eligible for participation. IER skills improvement as assessed by a vignette task is the primary outcome and will be analysed with a chi-square test. Secondary outcomes include feasibility and acceptability, emotional competence, personal emotion regulation, gender, and sex. Discussion This RCT will test whether playing a serious game about iER strategies results in an improvement of iER skills and whether the game is feasible and acceptable for early adolescents with the ultimate aim to implement the game in schools and help early adolescents achieve positive peer relationships.

11,"Informing the design of a multisensory learning environment for elementary mathematics learning","It is well known that primary school children may face difficulties in acquiring mathematical competence, possibly because teaching is generally based on formal lessons with little opportunity to exploit more multisensory-based activities within the classroom. To overcome such difficulties, we report here the exemplary design of a novel multisensory learning environment for teaching mathematical concepts based on meaningful inputs from elementary school teachers. First, we developed and administered a questionnaire to 101 teachers asking them to rate based on their experience the learning difficulty for specific arithmetical and geometrical concepts encountered by elementary school children. Additionally, the questionnaire investigated the feasibility to use multisensory information to teach mathematical concepts. Results show that challenging concepts differ depending on children school level, thus providing a guidance to improve teaching strategies and the design of new and emerging learning technologies accordingly. Second, we obtained specific and practical design inputs with workshops involving elementary school teachers and children. Altogether, these findings are used to inform the design of emerging multimodal technological applications, that take advantage not only of vision but also of other sensory modalities. In the present work, we describe in detail one exemplary multisensory environment design based on the questionnaire results and design ideas from the workshops: the Space Shapes game, which exploits visual and haptic/proprioceptive sensory information to support mental rotation, 2D3D transformation and percentages. Corroborating research evidence in neuroscience and pedagogy, our work presents a functional approach to develop novel multimodal user interfaces to improve education in the classroom.",NULL,NULL
12,"A Qualitative Evaluation of the Effects of Social Cognition and Interaction Training (SCIT) Versus Therapeutic Alliance Focused Therapy (TAFT) Among Persons With Serious Mental Illness","Growing appreciation of the impact of social cognition deficits on social functioning among people with serious mental illness (SMI) has led to the development of interventions that target them. The purpose of the present study was to conduct a qualitative analysis of the effectiveness of two group interventions, social cognition and interaction therapy (SCIT) and therapeutic alliance focused therapy (TAFT), and to explore the processes and factors that contribute to the SCIT and TAFT outcomes. Thirty-two participants (16 participants from each group) were interviewed after completing the interventions. Content analysis based on grounded theory was conducted by two psychologists. The majority of participants experienced the intervention they completed as beneficial. The completers attributed the positive changes to several factors including professional information, therapeutic alliance, and their own agency. Comparison of the two groups revealed that SCIT completers were more likely to report changes in their experience of self and in their daily coping, while TAFT completers were more likely to report changes in the way they felt. Although not the majority, five completers from each group reported a positive change in their interpersonal relationships. Integrative and flexible approaches to psychotherapy, which combine common factors and elicit health including actions, are important in order to improve social cognition deficits among people with SMI.",NULL,NULL
13,"A card-based internet of things game ideation tool for museum context","The increasing deployments of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies create new opportunities for game design for museums. Previous studies have highlighted the difficulty that designers face in generating ideas for IoT serious games. This paper proposes a card game solution that synthesises design knowledge for IoT serious games in museum with the aim of guiding non-experts in rapid idea generation for IoT serious games. It also helps designers design for in-depth visitor engagement to cater for the changing role of museums. We achieve this through different types of domain-specific cards (Asset, Engagement, Serious Game, IoT and Possible Issue). The card game, consisting of 90 cards for idea generation, was developed and evaluated through two iterative series of user workshops involving Human Computer Interaction (HCI) students. Results show that the card game was useful as a way to aid concept ideation for HCI designers and practitioners, with museums and their content used as a useful test case. We further discuss the strengths and limitations of the ideation tool.",NULL,NULL
14,"An Engaging Serious Game Aiming at Awareness of Therapy Skills Associated with Social Anxiety Disorder","Social anxiety disorder is characterized by sentiments of fear and anxiety in social interactions. This studys aim was to design and evaluate a serious game to raise awareness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) skills associated with social anxiety disorder. The target group was university students, as 1025% within this group have impaired functioning due to social anxiety. This study was based on three different iterations (study 1, study 2, and study 3), all included within a formative evaluation framework. In total, this study involved 71 university students, all within the 1831 age range. The game was designed in Unity with the implementation of different CBT skills within different scenarios. The scenarios were designed based on psychophysiological pilot testing in study 1, and external psychiatrist and psychologist expertise. The evaluation in study 2 and 3 was based on self-reports (questionnaires and interviews), and a recall knowledge check. The findings revealed that the designed serious game was successful in terms of focused attention, perceived usability, aesthetic appeal, being worthwhile, and narrative understanding. However, the designed elements could be improved by allowing more in-game personalization with the inclusion of the users own life experiences.",NULL,NULL
15,"Predictive Factors for Recurrence of Serious Arrhythmias in Patients with Acute Digoxin Poisoning","Although digoxin poisoning has declined in the past decades, it still has deleterious outcomes. The hallmark of serious life-threatening arrhythmias remains challenging due to its non-specific initial presentation. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the initial predictive factors for recurrent serious arrhythmias and the need for temporary pacing in acute digoxin-poisoned patients. This retrospective cohort study included all patients with acute digoxin poisoning admitted to Tanta University Poison Control Center from 2017 to 2020. Demographic and toxicological data, poisoning severity score (PSS), laboratory investigations, and serial ECG monitoring data were documented. Patients were divided according to their age into a childhood group and adolescence & adulthood group. Each age group was divided into two subgroups according to the presence of recurrent serious arrhythmias. Patient outcomes, including intensive care unit admission, temporary pacing, and in-hospital mortality were recorded. A percentage of 37.34% ( n =31) of the included patients had recurrent serious arrhythmias in both groups. Recurrent serious arrhythmias groups had significantly low heart rate, prolonged PR interval, high PSS, Mobitz II dysrhythmias, elevated serum digoxin, serum potassium and serum creatinine, and increased adverse outcomes compared to other groups. Logistic regression analysis showed that only serum digoxin and potassium levels were significant independent predictors of recurrent serious arrhythmias and temporary pacing. Serum digoxin level had an excellent discriminatory power with the best sensitivity and specificity, followed by serum potassium level in both groups. Thus, monitoring serum digoxin and potassium levels is essential in all patients with acute digoxin poisoning, especially with limited Fab availability.",NULL,NULL
16,"Personalized rehabilitation for children with cerebral palsy","Over the years, there has been an ongoing increase in the use of virtual gaming (VG) implemented via a range of technologies for the rehabilitation of children with disabilities including cerebral palsy (CP). While many VG-based devices have been developed over the past decade, many have been tested primarily for post-stroke therapy and included limited adaptation capabilities, not to mention personalization. When adaptation was included, it was not implemented dynamically in real-time but rather used to adjust the game parameters before a session. The goal and novel contribution of this study was to examine the potential of dynamic, within-session adaptation of virtual game parameters to support the rehabilitation of children with CP. The iVG4Rehab (Intelligent therapeutic Virtual Gaming System for Rehabilitation) system was designed and developed in collaboration with a team of clinicians. We aimed to demonstrate and evaluate the potential of a personalized virtual gaming system to support and enhance treatment of children with CP by real-time adaptations of game parameters to the childrens abilities and therapeutic needs. Our results validated the hypothesis that personalized system as a tool that has great potential for upper extremity (UE) therapy for children with CP and contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of their underlying performance, usability and kinematics in this unique context.",NULL,NULL
17,"Studying the effects of teaching programming to lower secondary school students with a serious game: a case study with Python and CodeCombat","Serious games, or else educational games, for programming are considered to have a positive impact on learning programming. Specifically, serious games are considered to motivate students and engage them in playing and learning programming. However, more research is required in order to study their effects in learning programming, as well as their added value in comparison with typical teaching approaches. In this study the effects of teaching programming to lower secondary school students with the serious game CodeCombat and the typical teaching approach are compared. Specifically, fifty-nine students formed an experimental group that was taught programming with CodeCombat and a control group that was taught programming through lecturing and problem solving in Python with a typical programming environment. The study aimed to investigate whether a game like CodeCombat that is based on a text-based real programming language: improves students performance in basic programming concepts; brings better learning outcomes in comparison with typical teaching methods; engages students interest. Data was collected through a pre and post test, as well as a survey prior the intervention and another one based on the Technology Acceptance Model at the end. It was concluded that the experimental group performed better than the control group, but this difference was not found to be statistically significant. CodeCombat was evaluated positively in terms of its perceived ease of use and usefulness, as well as the attitude towards its use. The results were neutral in terms of students behavioral intention to use CodeCombat, but were positive in using serious games for programming in general.",NULL,NULL
18,"A framework and immersive serious game for mild cognitive impairment","Cognitive decline is common in the elderly. As a result, a range of cognitive rehabilitation games have been proposed to supplement or replace traditional rehabilitative training by offering benefits such as improved engagement. In this paper, we focus on mild cognitive impairment (MCI), an initial stage of cognitive decline that does not affect functioning in daily life, but which may progress towards more serious cognitive deteriorations, notably dementia. Unfortunately, while a variety of serious game frameworks and rehabilitative serious games have been proposed, there is a distinct lack of those which support the distinctive characteristics of MCI patients. Consequently, to optimise the advantages of serious games for MCI, we propose the MCI-GaTE (MCI-Game Therapy Experience) framework that may be used to develop serious games as effective cognitive and physical rehabilitation tools. The framework is derived from a combination of a survey of related research literature in the area, analysis of resident profiles from a nursing home, and in-depth interviews with occupational therapists (OTs) who work with MCI patients on a daily basis. The conceptual framework comprises four sectors that may be used to guide game design and development: an MCI player profile that represents the capabilities of a player with MCI, core gaming elements that support gameful and playful activities, therapeutic elements that support cognitive and physical rehabilitation through tasks and scenarios according to the players abilities, and motivational elements to enhance the players attitude towards the serious tasks. Together, they provide support for rehabilitation needs and may also serve as a set of comprehensive and established criteria by which an MCI serious game may be evaluated. To demonstrate the use of MCI-GaTE , we also present A-go! , an immersive gesture-based serious game that exploits the framework to enable MCI-diagnosed players to undertake therapeutic tasks supported by an assigned OT. Evaluation with OTs revealed that the immersive game potentially offers more effective support to MCI patients than traditional methods, contributing new possibilities for enhancing MCI rehabilitative training, while a comparative assessment of MCI-GaTE demonstrated that it provides a comprehensive approach not currently offered by state-of-the-art rehabilitative frameworks.",NULL,NULL
19,"Short- and long-term learning of job interview with a serious game in virtual reality: influence of eyestrain, stereoscopy, and apparatus","Purpose Do apparatuses and eyestrain have effects on learning performances and quality of experience? Materials and Methods: 42 participants played a serious game simulating a job interview with a Samsung Gear VR Head-Mounted Display (HMD) or a computer screen. Participants were randomly assigned to 3 groups: PC, HMD biocular, and HMD stereoscopy (S3D). Participants played the game thrice. Eyestrain was assessed pre- and post-exposure with six optometric measures. Learning performances were obtained in-game. Quality of experience was measured with questionnaires. Results: eyestrain was higher with HMDs than PC based on Punctum Proximum of accommodation but similar between biocular and S3D. Knowledge gain and retention were similar with HMDs and PC based on scores and response time. All groups improved response time but without statistically significant differences between HMDs and PC. Visual discomfort difference was statistically significant between PC and HMDs (biocular and S3D). Flow difference was statistically significant between PC and HMDs (biocular and S3D), with the PC group reporting higher Flow than HMD-S3D. Conclusion: short-term learning is similar between PC and HMDs. Groups initially using HMDs continued improving during long-term learning but without statistically significant difference compared to PC. Eyestrain and visual discomfort were higher with HMDs than PC. Flow was higher with the PC group. Our results show that eyestrain does not seem to decrease learning.",NULL,NULL

21,"Toward emotional interactive videogames for children with autism spectrum disorder","Technology and videogames have been proven as motivating tools for working attention and complex communication skills, especially in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this work, we present two experiences that used interactive games for promoting communication and attention. The first game considers emotions in order to measure childrens attention, concentration and satisfaction, while the second uses tangible tabletops for fostering cognitive planning. The analysis of the results obtained allows to propose a new study integrating both, in which the tangible interactive game is complemented with the emotional trainer in a way that allows identifying and classifying childrens emotion with ASD when they collaborate to solve cognitively significant and contextualized challenges. The first application proposed is an emotional trainer application in which the child can work out the seven basic emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, anger, surprise and neutral). Further, a serious videogame is proposed: a 3D maze where the emotions can be captured. The second case study was carried out in a Special Education Center, where a set of activities for working cognitive planning was proposed. In this case, a tangible interactive tabletop was used to analyze, in students with ASD, how the communication processes with these interfaces affect to the attention, memory, successive and simultaneous processing that compose cognitive planning from the PASS model. The results of the first study, suggest that the autistic children did not act with previous planning, but they used their perception to adjust their actions a posteriori (that explains the higher number of collisions). On the second case study, the successive processing was not explored. The inclusion of the mazes of case study 1 to a semantic rich scenario could allow us to measure the prior planning and the emotions involved in the maze game. The new physiological sensors will also help to validate the emotions felt by the children. The first study has as objective the capability to imitate emotions and resolve a maze without semantic context. The second study organized all the actions from a semantic context close to users. The attention results presented by the second study are coherent with the first study and complement it showing that attention can be receptive or selective. In the first study case, the receptive attention was the focus of analysis. In the second case, both contributed to explain and understand how it can be developed from a videogame.",NULL,NULL

23,"Evoking emotions in virtual reality: schema activation via a freeze-frame stimulus","Virtual reality can be used for educational purposes, particularly in demanding professions such as firefighting. Such virtual training may be useful for preparing trainees for distress, fear, or frustration experienced during real rescue operations. Evoking cognitive schemas, especially of other people, during training appears to be crucial as well, as the greatest stressors in the firefighting profession are social. Based on interviews with firefighters, two types of people (children and young women) were chosen as stimuli in the research design. In an experimental study with three iterations, the stimuli designed to evoke the schema of a significant other were implemented in a virtual reality simulator to evoke a cognitive schema in firefighters through emotions (positive and negative) and several dimensions of stress. The first iteration of the study did not yield expected results, as the stimulus (a childs toy) was not as suggestive and vivid as it was expected. In the second attempt, the stimulus was improved and evoked feelings of challenge, harm, and loss in the participants. In the third iteration, the stimulus was changed once more (to a white dress) and this time it evoked negative emotions of fear, anger, guilt, and sadness. However, after correcting for multiple comparisons, only results regarding emotional response remained statistically significant. The results are discussed in light of cognitive schemas activation, and perspectives for further research in this scope are proposed. Due to research outcomes, the issues of manipulation checks in experimental psychology and limitations of the VR technology are taken into consideration.",NULL,NULL
24,"Explicit and Implicit Emotional Expression in Gambling Disorder Measured by a Serious Game: A Pilot Study","Behavioral addictions have been related with biased emotional reactions to risky choices. However, few studies have analyzed the role of both explicit and implicit emotional expression in gambling disorder (GD). This pilot study aims to examine emotion regulation in treatment-seeking patients with GD. The sample included n =35 participants classified into three groups: patients with current GD, patients with GD in remission, and a control group without GD. Implicit emotional expressions were evaluated through a serious videogame (Playmancer) and explicit emotions were measured through self-reports. Patients in the current GD group had, compared to the remission and control groups, lower levels of implicit emotion expression and higher levels of explicit emotion expression. The patients in GD remission group endorsed better emotion regulation capacity in comparison to patients with current GD. We conclude that differences in emotion expression profiles (such as anger and anxiety) should be considered both in the development of screening and diagnostic measures and in the planning of prevention and treatment programs.",NULL,NULL
25,"A mobile VR-based respiratory biofeedback game to foster diaphragmatic breathing","Virtual reality (VR) has become popular in mental health research. Several studies have explored the use of VR in the context of biofeedback protocols. In the present paper, we report on the development and evaluation of a VR-based respiratory biofeedback game to foster diaphragmatic breathing. The game integrates respiratory biofeedback, restorative VR and gamification. The game is designed to run on a mobile, all-in-one VR headset. Notably, an integrated VR hand controller is utilized as a sensor to detect respiration-induced movements of the diaphragm. In a longitudinal within-subjects study, we explored the feasibility of the game and tested the effectiveness of six training sessions. Participants reported a pleasant user experience. Moreover, the results show that the brief VR-based breathing training increased perceived breath awareness, improved diaphragmatic breathing, increased relaxation, decreased perceived stress, reduced symptoms of burnout and boosted relaxation-related self-efficacy. Future studies need to address the generalizability and long-term stability of the results, compare the approach with existing treatments and fine-tune the training components.",NULL,NULL

The serious game Vil Du?! was developed to help children open up about sexual experiences. Vil Du?! is a non-verbal communication game, which resembles a dress-up game, in which children can show the therapist what happened to them. The current study examined how and for which therapy components Vil Du?! was used by therapists. Methods We used a mixed-methods triangulation design. Therapists filled out online surveys about the use of Vil Du?! with 23 clients ( M age = 11.38 years, SD =3.96; 61% female). We also conducted semi-structured interviews with 10 therapists. The data were analyzed in SPSS (quantitative) and Nvivo (qualitative) following the stepwise guidelines of Zhang and Wildemuth. Results Merged qualitative and quantitative data revealed that therapists acknowledged the usefulness of Vil Du?! mostly for the therapy components trauma narration and processing, and psycho-education about sexuality. In addition, Vil Du?! might be most useful for clients who have difficulty with disclosing sexual abuse experiences, due to limited verbal abilities or feelings of guilt, shame, avoidance, and tension. Conclusions Recommendations from this study were incorporated in a user manual as a first step toward more systematic and broad implementation of Vil Du?! in the treatment of young sexual abuse victims. A next step is to test whether implementing Vil Du?! in therapy is effective in reducing the negative mental health consequences of sexual abuse for children and adolescents.",NULL,NULL
27,"Good gamers, good managers? A proof-of-concept study with Sid Meiers Civilization","Human resource professionals increasingly enhance their assessment tools with game elementsa process typically referred to as gamificationto make them more interesting and engaging for candidates, and they design and use serious games that can support skill assessment and development. However, commercial, off-the-shelf video games are not or are only rarely used to screen or test candidates, even though there is increasing evidence that they are indicative of various skills that are professionally valuable. Using the strategy game Civilization , this proof-of-concept study explores if strategy video games are indicative of managerial skills and, if so, of what managerial skills. Under controlled laboratory conditions, we asked forty business students to play the Civilization game and to participate in a series of assessment exercises. We find that students who had high scores in the game had better skills related to problem-solving and organizing and planning than the students who had low scores. In addition, a preliminary analysis of in-game data, including players interactions and chat messages, suggests that strategy games such as Civilization may be used for more precise and holistic stealth assessments, including personality assessments.",NULL,NULL
28,"Gamification of health professions education: a systematic review","Gamification refers to using game attributes in a non-gaming context. Health professions educators increasingly turn to gamification to optimize students learning outcomes. However, little is known about the concept of gamification and its possible working mechanisms. This review focused on empirical evidence for the effectiveness of gamification approaches and theoretical rationales for applying the chosen game attributes. We systematically searched multiple databases, and included all empirical studies evaluating the use of game attributes in health professions education. Of 5044 articles initially identified, 44 met the inclusion criteria. Negative outcomes for using gamification were not reported. Almost all studies included assessment attributes (n=40), mostly in combination with conflict/challenge attributes (n=27). Eight studies revealed that this specific combination had increased the use of the learning material, sometimes leading to improved learning outcomes. A relatively small number of studies was performed to explain mechanisms underlying the use of game attributes (n=7). Our findings suggest that it is possible to improve learning outcomes in health professions education by using gamification, especially when employing game attributes that improve learning behaviours and attitudes towards learning. However, most studies lacked well-defined control groups and did not apply and/or report theory to understand underlying processes. Future research should clarify mechanisms underlying gamified educational interventions and explore theories that could explain the effects of these interventions on learning outcomes, using well-defined control groups, in a longitudinal way. In doing so, we can build on existing theories and gain a practical and comprehensive understanding of how to select the right game elements for the right educational context and the right type of student.",NULL,NULL
29,"Serious games for basic learning mechanisms: reinforcing Mexican childrens gross motor skills and attention","Early childhood is the most important and rapid period of development in a human life as it is a period where the maturation of the brain and the central nervous system take place. In fact, researchers have established some theories and several studies indicating the relationship between brain maturity and learning disabilities. Nonetheless, when academic problems are present, therapy intervention approaches often consider the stimulation of sensory-motor functions as a key to help children reinforce their weaknesses. The configuration of goal-oriented for sensory integration therapy, however, is time-consuming and based on the expertise of the therapists clinical eye. Considering this, we approached a special education institution and conducted a 5-month user-centered design study to understand practices on supportive learning therapy, and evaluated the impact on childrens behavior after their interaction with a serious game aiming to stimulate sensory functions. Our findings indicate the serious game affected positively the childrens basic learning mechanisms (BLMs), by reinforcing balance, visual-motor, memory, attention, and spatial awareness abilities while interacting with the serious game. Therapists and parents informed about improvement with the engagement on therapy and home activities, and posture and calmness to complete scholar assignments. Future developments would consider improvements on gameplay, as well as accessible resources to inform therapists about childrens achievements in order to support therapy interventions.",NULL,NULL
30,"Social acceptance of serious games for physical and cognitive training in older adults residing in ambient assisted living environments","Aims Although ambient assisted living (AAL) environments and serious games for healthcare have been proposed as solutions to meet the changing demographics, the two approaches are rarely combined. We present the development and empirical evaluation of two serious games for healthcare in AAL. The first uses a cooking scenario for training of cognitive functioning. The latter uses a gardening scenario and motion capture for training agility and endurance. As the frequent lack of social acceptance is a major challenge in consumer health technology, we integrated methods of technology acceptance research by means of the UTAUT2-model and intention to use into the evaluation. Subject and methods We developed both games utilizing user-centered and participatory design methods ranging from low-fidelity paper prototypes to usability and acceptance evaluations of functional prototypes. In the final evaluation, each game prototype was evaluated by 64 participants form different age groups. Results The results show that although performance decreases with age, the performance attained in the games is not decisive for social acceptance measured as intention to use. However, user diversity factors shape the evaluation of the games, and older people and people with low technical competence are in danger of being excluded from using serious games for healthcare. Conclusion Exercise games, if designed right, can mitigate the negative effects of demographic change. Nevertheless, user diversity needs must be considered to ensure that the games are usable and used by a broad audience. The article concludes with guidelines and open research questions for the design of serious games in AAL environments.",NULL,NULL
31,"Knowledge-construction behaviors in a mobile learning environment: a lag-sequential analysis of group differences","Mobile serious games are increasingly utilized as educational tools in elementary schools, and a considerable body of research has focused on evaluating such games educational effectiveness. However, such work has generally ignored learning processes, and especially how knowledge is constructed. Given the important role of knowledge construction in various educational settings, this study examines it in the context of 83 elementary schoolers mobile serious game-playing behaviors. Lag-sequential analysis of the participants observed behavioral patterns, and of differences in such patterns between two performance subgroups (i.e., students with high vs. low academic performance), yielded two main findings. First, all these young learners exhibited knowledge construction, and moved smoothly from lower to higher phases of it in the mobile environment; and second, the high-performing group attained a deeper level of knowledge construction through the negotiation of meaning than the low-performing group did. Some theoretical and practical implications of these results are also discussed.",NULL,NULL
32,"Multimedia augmented reality game for learning math","The traditional method for learning the multiplication tables is a repetitive and boring task. Teachers try to find new methods to motivate children in this tedious duty, and one of the lines to consider is to integrate en- tertainment into educational processes. This work presents a new multimedia interaction approach in order to allow children to practice these math opera- tions and have fun. The learning process has been gamified by means of two mini-games designed for mobile platforms, based on meromictic or repetitive learning. The genre of these mini-games have been selected according to chil- dren preferences: one turn-based fighting and other throwing-objects game. A series of proposed multiplications have to be solved during the play to per- form the player actions. Moreover, in order to support learning engagement, both have been visualized through Augmented Reality, combining real and virtual reality. This paper discusses the good results of mixing entertainment with some learning tasks, due to the engagement of the children to the mobile based games. A pilot study has been performed in order to evaluate the learn- ing effectiveness and usability of the proposal. Results support that playing the video games makes this tedious multiplication practice more enjoyable and attractive for children so they improve their math skills.",NULL,NULL
33,"Comparing the effectiveness of fire extinguisher virtual reality and video training","Fire is a major hazard in built environments. Fires in buildings cause fatalities, serious injuries and tremendous damage. Most fires can be extinguished in the early stages of the fires development, with the right equipment and correct use of the equipment. However, as there can be as little as a few minutes between a fire starting and very dire consequences, rapid and correct responses are critical. Implementing effective training solutions is necessary to enable members of the public, who are not experts in fire safety, to use a fire extinguisher correctly. This can assist to build resilience to fires. In recent decades, virtual reality (VR) has aroused the fire safety communitys attention, as a smart, safe and effective training method compared to the traditional methods of lectures, non-interactive videos, and brochures. VR has been used for training for fire emergency preparedness and to collect data about evacuee decision-making, but VR has rarely been applied to a fully immersive training experience about fire extinguishers operation steps. Fire extinguisher operation steps are Pull, Aim, Squeeze and Sweep. Each step is critical to quickly extinguish a fire. This paper compares fire extinguisher training using a VR simulation with a non-interactive training video and evaluates the trainees learning of a fire extinguishers basic operation steps, in terms of knowledge acquisition, retention of information and change of self-efficacy. The results showed that the VR trainees scored better than video trainees, in terms of knowledge acquisition, even if the same trend was observed for long term retention of information. It was also observed that VR training provided a higher increment of self-efficacy right after the training. The VR group participants had maintained the same level of self-efficacy even 34weeks after the training, while the video group had shown a significant drop of self-efficacy.",NULL,NULL

In response, a group of concerned residents emerged to educate the public and engage with regulators. However, the obscurities of the helium industry and regulatory frameworks complicated the groups efforts. This paper details a participatory action research project called Helium Futures , a co-designed serious board. We argue that Helium Futures generated capacity for engagement by collaboratively distilling industry and regulatory perspectives, as well as resulted in a device for enrolling allies. Helium Futures , furthermore, highlights how empowerment occurs when situated expertise is accounted for in design-oriented action research.

37,"PeppeRecycle: Improving Childrens Attitude Toward Recycling by Playing with a Social Robot","In this paper, we investigate the use of a social robot as an engaging interface of a serious game intended to make children more aware and well disposed towards waste recycle. The game has been designed as a competition between the robot Pepper and a child. During the game, the robot simultaneously challenges and teaches the child how to recycle waste materials. To endow the robot with the capability to play as a game opponent in a real-world context, it is equipped with an image recognition module based on a Convolutional Neural Network to detect and classify the waste material as a child would do, i.e. by simply looking at it. A formal experiment involving 51 primary school students is carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the game in terms of different factors such as the interaction with the robot, the users cognitive and affective dimensions towards ecological sustainability, and the propensity to recycle. The obtained results are encouraging and draw promising scenarios for educational robotics in changing childrens attitudes toward recycling. Indeed Pepper turns out to be positively evaluated by children as a trustful and believable companion and this allows children to be concentrated on the memorization task during the game. Moreover, the use of real objects as waste items during the game turns out to be a successful approach not only for perceived learning effectiveness but also for the childrens engagement.",NULL,NULL

Traditional therapy for children diagnosed with autism comprises a set of activities aimed at improving behavioral traits often associated with social and communication skills. However, the therapy process is challenging as every child responds differently to the intervention. There are usually long wait lists for treatment and there are high demands for the time clinicians can provide for treatment. Games, and serious games in particular, that can be easily tailored to the needs of specific individuals, and that can span a wide range of scenarios, are proving to be effective alternatives to traditional therapy. Here we present an autism serious game framework (ASGF) whose goal is to provide therapists with a simple interface that will allow them to develop various serious game interventions. Using the ASGF, we have developed two games, one whose goal is to help users identify emotions by matching facial expressions such as happiness, anger, fear, or sadness, and another, which focuses on response inhibition. The ASGF employs a graphical user interface-based, What You See Is What You Get interface, that simplifies the development of autism serious games.",NULL,NULL

53,"Affective Virtual Reality Gaming for Autism","Emotional impairment is one of the common symptoms of many mental diseases. Being able to learn the emotional reactions from subjects using nonintrusive human-computer interactions (HCI) would provide a novel and efficient approach to assist existing intervention and therapy. Psychologists conducted research using virtual reality (VR) as a tool for exposure starting from decades ago. However, early VR equipment was cumbersome in size and inefficient, which can only be used to simulate limited scenes, such as car driving and phobia scenarios. With the evolution of affordable and portable VR hardware, we are now able to design systematic VR games that can precisely control variables for different stimuli and testing cases. Furthermore, the VR nowadays can serve not only as exposure methods, but also real games that seamlessly and nonintrusively interact with users. The experience of immersion and presence has made VR naturally suitable for triggering strong emotions. Moreover, the study of affective computing, known as the study and development of systems and devices that can recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human affects, is a trendy and challenging topic in HCI field. Given current research and potential development, affective computing is seeking to develop emotional intelligence in machines. Integrating the concept of affective computing into game design and development will lead to a new type of serious games that interact with users emotions. This chapter reviews the methodologies commonly used in affective computing and related research projects using VR exposure as an intervention for people with special needs. It also describes a series of studies conducted to collect and analyze data. Our goal is to propose a game framework that recognizes users emotional reactions in a multimodal approach, which, with ideal expectation, adapts according to the fluctuation of the users emotional states dynamically. The system provides a guideline for affective gaming design for mental healthcare purposes. The application of the framework is to assist in intervention for autistic spectrum disorder and can be extended to other emotion-related mental illness.",NULL,NULL

56,"A Wolf, Hyena, and Fox Game to Raise Cybersecurity Awareness Among Pre-school Children","Currently, children have a greater exposure to cyberspace and cyber threats than any previous generation. Digital technologies are evolving continuously with the result that cell phones, tablets and similar devices are more accessible to both young and old. Technological advancements create many opportunities, however it also exposes its users to many threats. Pre-school children are especially vulnerable to these threats, as they are rarely made aware of, or empowered to defend themselves against these threats. An approach to solving this problem is to create a mobile serious game that promotes cybersecurity awareness among pre-school children. The focus of this paper is the part of the game that promotes the use of strong passwords and not sharing these passwords with ones friends.",NULL,NULL

58,"Natural Language to Facilitate the Analysis of Statistical Evaluation of Educational Digital Games","The application of educational digital games (EDG) requires multiple perspectives for an optimal adaptation. This study shows how relevant feedback is presented in simple outcome reports of EDG-based learning for teachers and parents in Natural Language (NL). NL as a Machine Learning process also can represent quantitative data sets in consumable Spanish language statements. The objective is to improve outcomes of EDG platforms using a cloud-based dashboard used to evaluate student EDG application behavioral efficiency. A novel tool is proposed to provide simple language explanations rather than statistical representations of feedback to parents and teachers in marginal areas of developing economies. With fuzzy logic, the researchers present verbatim explanations of student behavior towards educational EDG. Results reveal comprehensive, simple, or colloquial Spanish language information for parents and teachers to provide improved evaluation keys to enhance student learning via EDG related to the school curricula.",NULL,NULL
59,"Serious Games as Assessment Tools: Visualizing Sustainable Creative Competence in the Field of Retail","Serious games are garnering popularity in learning environments and as assessment tools. We propose a summative assessment of a serious game as an assessment tool by merging assessment standards with serious game mechanics. To this end, we apply instructional design components with a focus on the evidence-centered game design approach (ECgD). Simultaneously, we introduce a different approach to game design and the traditional chain of effects toward competence assessment. Our leading questions are: how can the competences be operationalized and translated into game mechanics? Through which serious game mechanics can we prompt players to act in typical domain-specific situations and show their sustainable creative competence? How and through which statistical models can we match the observed competence of players with the intended competence model formulated a priori? To answer these questions, we developed the domain-specific serious game MyBUY to assess the sustainable creative competence (SC competence) of young adults in Vocational Education and Training in the field of retail and sales. By matching the intended competence (theoretical model) while playing the serious game with the SC competence (empirical model), we found that the models were highly compatible. Further confirmation is given by the results of questionnaires on usability, cognitive load, and motivation. Our results affirm the need for future studies to apply our algorithm to design domain-specific serious games as competence assessment tools and extend data collection and data analytics procedures in longitudinal studies.",NULL,NULL

Nevertheless, it is crucial to employ methods and protocols to that ensure certain criteria and goals are met during their development. For that intention, we propose the Mechanics for Engagement Design Protocol (MEDP), a procedure that emerges from the need to consider the mechanisms explored through the Design, Play and Experience (DPE) frameworks dimensions to meet a serious games goals, while considering the player profiles according to the Engagement Model. This protocol was implemented and tested during the development of FlavourGame (FG), a serious game that aims to promote discussion and awareness about nutrition for children. The exploration and testing process also allowed to support the MEDP for other serious game projects, as well as to consider the state of the art of current analogue and hybrid games related to food, the theme of FG.",NULL,NULL

This paper introduces the Gamers4Nature toolkit to Game Design and its use by upper-secondary (N=53) and undergraduate (N=114) students along several game design sessions addressing an environmental preservation theme. As result of these sessions, 66 prototypes of digital games were produced. The toolkit was used through questionnaires applied by the end of the game design sessions. Results indicate that the Toolkit was a very useful resource in scaffolding the narrative construction process and that its resources are adequate to be used by for both upper-secondary and undergraduate students, and that it can be seen as a valuable resource to support educators and trainers in educational and serious game design activities.",NULL,NULL

All participants were recruited from two chemistry classes at a Danish elementary school in Copenhagen. A formative evaluation consisted of both a questionnaire, observations, and interviews. The questionnaire was inspired by the User Engagement Scale (UES) short-form. Designing a serious game for pupils with the aim to increase the understanding of molecular structures, is not an easy task. This serious game was to some extend able to engage the pupils within the subject of chemistry. The game itself was reported to be very engaging, but the specific learning outcomes remains uncertain. We can conclude that the serious game was visually appealing, the pupils were absorbed in the game, and wanted to continue playing. However, the designed serious game was also a bit confusing and made too difficult, resulting in frustrations for the pupils. Further, there are still some important challenges in how to increase the validity and reliability when evaluating serious games with children and adolescent as the users.",NULL,NULL
64,"A Review of Indie Games for Serious Mental Health Game Design","Mental health disorders present a global challenge being the largest contributor to non-fatal burden of disease. In fact, those who are experiencing symptoms of mental illness often wait ten years before seeking help. This is frequently due to help-seeking barriers such as stigma and cost. One way to combat help-seeking barriers is through increasing the mental health literacy of the public. This has been achieved successfully through digital delivery of mental health information and services, including serious games. Early research suggests that serious games are an effective tool for improving mental health literacy. However, factors such as poor-quality game design and research studies mean that developers face challenges when designing, developing, and analyzing serious games. To address these challenges this paper will provide an analysis of indie games that feature topics of mental health, trauma, and grief. Indie games share similarities to research environments, often being created by small teams on a limited budget. Even with these limitations they can tell impactful and emotional stories, making them a valuable source of inspiration for developers of serious mental health games.",NULL,NULL
65,"Proposal for a Serious Game to Assist in the Daily Care of Children with ASD Before Covid-19","Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a condition of neurodevelopment characterized by changes in social communication, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviors. Many children with ASD need different types of intervention (behavioral, language, social, occupational, among others). Since the appearance of Covid-19 in December 2019, a state of world pandemic has been established. In Brazil, it started in March 2020. The lives of millions of people in the country have been drastically changed: schools have closed in their face-to-face mode, people began to leave home only in extreme need, and health care was changed to the virtual model. Children with autism had their appointments reduced or canceled and, after a few months, changed to an online version. The use of masks has become mandatory throughout the country. These children now need to live in a different environment than they did a long time ago. It becomes, for example, more difficult for them to understand what people say due to the use of masks. Thus, this project aims to present a serious game in which the child can train his/her ability to understand the words now spoken by people using a face protection mask, without the possibility of the visual feature of the facial face mimic. The game was validated by nine speech therapists and, subsequently, by fourteen children diagnosed with ASD who already do speech therapy sessions online. It happened during one of the sessions. Then, both groups answered a satisfaction questionnaire conducted by the speech therapist, adapted to their characteristics.",NULL,NULL
66,"Serious Games to Support Agile and Lean Methodologies","Higher education prepares learners for their future role as professionals and active citizens by building field specific knowledge as well as soft, transversal skills. It further prepares students to effectively transition from the educational environment into the professional world, to become productively integrated into the professionally community, and to adapt to market-driven processes. To effectively facilitate this transition, higher education offerings must expose students to industry processes rather than be limited to the development of theoretical knowledge. This exposure may be achieved to a certain degree through specific courses; more effectively, it may be achieved through the integration of hands on activities into curricula that challenge students to use new skills and competencies in an environment that simulates the way industry deploys knowledge. This work presents the LEAP learning intervention towards building experience among higher education engineering students on emerging lean and agile industry practices. This is pursued through the design and implementation of serious games that allow students to build experience on the benefits of lean and agile design in broad engineering scenarios that go beyond the sectors in which these methods were originally introduced.",NULL,NULL

The majority of them are not independent, even for the most basic financial activities. In this paper, we illustrated the design of a serious game (SG), UReka , for teens with ASD to train skills useful to recognize and discriminate Euro coins and banknotes and to use them in real-life situations. We followed SGs frameworks for people with ASD and we adopted a participatory design, involving a multidisciplinary team. We included a short version of our game design document to explain how serious contents, game elements, and needs of the players with ASD were balanced in our SG. UReka consists of two 3D mini-games set in real-life environments, with a simple storyline and user-friendly graphics. The player can individualize their gaming experience, customizing some game options based on their preferences and needs. We developed a first game prototype that will be evaluated through a usability test.

This disorder includes symptoms such as hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity. Technological advances benefit the learning of this group of children, creating tools that strengthen their abilities and skills and support cognitive therapies. In particular, Serious Game (SG) are well-structured videogames to learning in entertainment settings. With the background, CIUDAD PUZZLE was designed with mini-puzzle games using Near Field Communication (NFC) technology. This SG allows for strengthening the treatment of 20 children from 7 to 10 years old diagnosed with ADHD. For experimentation, the childrens attention level was measured before and after using the SG, for which the Perception of differences test (faces-R) was used.

This stigma denies individuals who have a mental illness the opportunity to lead everyday lives and leaves them reluctant to seek professional help for their illness. A form of therapy called Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) has proven to be very effective for various mental health issues. Serious game-based storytelling is a form of digital game that aims to create a virtual environment where the player encounters and solves problems in the games world for purposes other than entertainment, for example health and education.

73,"Factors Affecting Game-Based Learning Experience: The Case of Serious Games","The paper presents the results of a study in which the users experience when playing serious games (in terms of gaming and learning) was examined; in an effort to determine which factors contribute significantly to the above and how they are related. Two serious games were used (one 2D and one 3D) and the target group was 384 university students. A questionnaire was used for collecting data; consisting of ten open-ended questions. All questions urged participants to make suggestions for improving an equal number of factors which were hypothesized to shape the learning experience in serious games. A total of 2745 valid responses were thematically analyzed and quantified. The results indicated that the games were viewed as a form of digital learning material rather than as games. That is because two factors related to the serious facet of serious games; namely; feedback and the quality of the learning material; were the only ones which accumulated a significant number of responses; indicating them as being important for the games learning effectiveness. The findings highlighted the need for further research in this field; but they can also serve as the basis for the development of more comprehensive serious games evaluation methods.",NULL,NULL
74,"Using Indie Games to Inform Serious Mental Health Games Design","Mental health literacy (MHL) is an important 21 st Century skill. Good MHL can help to reduce barriers to help-seeking by equipping the public with the knowledge needed to help themselves or someone experiencing a mental illness. One Australian-based organization that does this through a training course is Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) Australia. There are many digital interventions that aim to achieve this goal and serious games are no exception. Serious games have been identified as ideal for developing 21 st Century skills, meaning MHL literacy is a promising candidate for serious games development. In fact, evidence suggest that serious games are effective as a tool for improving MHL. However, they often suffer from poor-quality game design, poor study design, high dropout rates, variability in studies and loss of motivation and engagement of players. This means that there are many challenges to consider when developing serious games. Here we describe our experiences in the development of a serious game prototype that utilizes the principles of MHFA. The aim of this development is to improve the confidence of players in delivering MHFA. Additionally, it aims to address the challenge of serious games quality by taking an artistic approach that combines narrative, aesthetics and mechanics using indie games for inspiration. There are many well-designed indie games that tell emotional and character driven stories of mental illness. They provide inspiration on the development of honest and relatable characters, which offer a positive representation of those experiencing a mental illness.",NULL,NULL
75,"Designing Analytic Serious Games: An Expert Affordance View on Privacy Decision-Making","With advancing digitalisation and the associated ubiquitous data processing, people face frequent privacy decisions. As personal data is often collected and processed in non-transparent ways, decision-making is tedious and regularly results in unthoughtful choices that resign privacy to comfort. Serious Games (SG) could be instrumentalised to raise awareness about privacy concerns and investigate how better privacy decisions can be encouraged. However, creating a SG that can research and promote better privacy choices while providing exciting gameplay requires carefully balanced game design. In this study, we interviewed 20 international experts in privacy, psychology, education, game studies, and interaction design to elicit design suggestions for analytic Serious Games that can be applied to research and improve privacy decision-making. With a mixed-method approach, we conducted a qualitative affordance analysis and quantified the findings to determine each expert groups perceptions of how to investigate and educate privacy decision-making with games while keeping an engaging experience for players. The findings suggest that privacy decision-making is best analysed by storytelling that extends to a real-world context and engages the player with curiosity. Decision-making investigation is suggested to either apply unobtrusive in-game monitoring with story-aligned character interrogation, switching to a meta-context or include personal data and devices from daily routines. Conclusively, design implications for analytic SG targeting privacy are synthesised from the experts suggestions.",NULL,NULL

Comput. 7(3), 2-es (2007). 10.1145/1281320.1281322). Video games have transformed how we spend our leisure time, and started to transform how we learn through serious games (Young et al. in Rev. Educ. Res. 82:6189, Young Mar. Rev. Educ. Res. 82:6189, 2012). Developed economies have used serious games in multiple domains like military, healthcare, or telecom to train workforce (Liarokapis and de Freitas in A Case Study of Augmented Reality Serious Games, IGI Global, Liarokapis, F., de Freitas, S.

The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine can protect against human papillomavirus that leads to different types of cancers. However, HPV vaccination rates are low. This study explored the effectiveness of a narrative-based interactive game about the HPV vaccines as a method to communicate knowledge and perhaps create behavioral outcomes. We developed a serious storytelling game called Vaccination Vacation inspired by personal narratives of individuals who were impacted by the HPV. We tested the game using a randomized control study of 99 adult participants and compared the HPV knowledge and vaccine beliefs of the Gamer Group (who played the game, n=44) and the Reader group (who read a vaccine information sheet, n=55). We also evaluated the usability of the game. In addition to high usability, the interactive game slightly impacted the beliefs about the HPV vaccine over standard delivery of vaccine information, especially among those who never received the HPV vaccine. We also observed some gender-based differences in perception towards usability and the likelihood of frequently playing the game. A narrative-based game could bring positive changes to players HPV-related health beliefs. The combination of more comprehensive HPV vaccine information with the narratives may produce a larger impact. Narrative-based games can be effectively used in other vaccine education interventions and warrant future research.",NULL,NULL

79,"Designing Interactive Storytelling Games to Teach Computational Thinking","In the section of The Design of Everyday Things titled Moral Obligations of Design, Don Norman writes, Designers need to make things that satisfy peoples needs, in terms of function, in terms of being understandable and usable, and in terms of their ability to deliver emotional satisfaction, pride, and delight, (Norman, 293). This is equally true of doors, lessons, teapots, narratives, and games. And for some complex emerging objects, such as educational narrative games, designers must look at a synthesis of different object types to hypothesize heuristics and principles that will guide their design. Game designers rarely have extensive research on the design of their artifacts to analyze before they are asked to invent new combinations of mechanics, couple them with themes they did not create, and then test their efficacy for whatever the intended design goal of the game, be it education, entertainment, or training. Instead, designers often rely on anecdotal accounts of design of their genre of games, if they're fortunate, or on heuristics uncovered most often in other fields. In conversation with games studies and interactive storytelling scholars, I define these digital artifacts as games that use narratives generated in response to open text input from their players. For the emerging genre of interactive storytelling games the dearth of game design research and a lack of examples of fully functional games in the genre give designers little to start with. Though many in the field of interactive storytelling believe, for good reason, that these games have incredible educational potential, there are even fewer examples of such games to learn from, and practically no specific game design research on their creation. Such artifacts are the complex synthesis of generated narrative, a system open to a continuum of user input, and educational content that personalizes to the player to a high degree. Without proper design, these objects will fail to be understood, to satisfy their users needs, to function, and they will certainly fail to deliver pride, satisfaction, and delight. Without game design research, the proper design of such complicated artifacts will happen only by accident and will most likely be delayed, possibly indefinitely. In what seems at first like an odd coincidence, there is one field, computational thinking, where two effective prototypes of interactive storytelling educational games exist, and these, along with other case studies of mechanics and even science fiction, can guide the beginning of game design research into their creation. How can we design interactive storytelling systems in order to be effective at teaching computational thinking? While the industry process of iteration and design will be key, the costs of developing these systems, and the costs of designing them improperly, are too high not to attempt other formal approaches to researching their design. By following a game design research methodology and pursuing specific cases with the formal methods, this paper analyzes game design principles and hypotheses to produce knowledge about how to design these complex and potentially transformational objects. As Don Norman makes clear in The Design of Everyday Things, not only can design increase our enjoyment and understanding of those things around us, but design can be a life or death matter. The stakes may seem lower in game design; however, as James Paul Gee points out in his work on games and education, games are sites of identity formation and for learning their own unique semiotic domains (Gee). We need to design the powerful educational systems that will emerge from the synthesis of deep learning and natural language processes with care, so that we do not allow for stochastic identity formation in the players of these games. This paper is a research-based analysis of interactive storytelling systems and relevant games with relevant mechanics in order to address the question of how to design interactive storytelling games that teach computational thinking in an informal context. In addition to this analysis, this paper describes relevant research into narrative-centered learning, games-based learning, and informal learning. I will also analyze science fiction criticism alongside my game design research, and research into other fields, by adapting a methodology used in ubiquitous computing research that recognizes that, Design-oriented research is an act of collective imagininga way in which we work together to bring about a future that lies slightly out of our grasp, (Dourish and Bell, 769). In this way, I will expand upon and practice game design research methods as called for by Paul Coultan and Alan Hook, game design researchers at Lancaster University. Currently, even formal tools such as machinations.io and more formal texts on game mechanics such as Patterns In Game Design do not delve into thorough specific game design considerations around creating interactive storytelling systems as described by authors such as Chris Crawford, Brenda Laurel, and Janet Murray (Bjrk and Holopainen; Crawford; Laurel; Murray). Ultimately, this paper will provide insight into how game designers can design interactive storytelling systems in order to teach computational thinking in informal settings, in hopes that these lessons will apply to the emerging field of interactive storytelling design and their use in informal learning experiences.",NULL,NULL

This study focuses on a smaller part of the project called PUDCAD (Practicing Universal Design Principles in Design Education through a CAD-Based Game), which aims to increase awareness and empathy of design students about design problems regarding people with disabilities. The project develops through 4 student workshops and three international conferences on Universal Design, Ergonomics, Game, and Education. This paper focuses on the third workshop held in Florence in Design Campus Firenze, specifically on the board game workshop process, excluding the held conferences. In the workshop, Design students were asked to work in groups and given a task to create a board game based on inclusive design principles and elaborate on game mechanics regarding inclusive design. Later they are given an open-ended questionnaire about how they found it and how they would implement the mechanics to an educational video game. Final board game outputs are then taken to a comparison chart to define the mechanics and reveal the similarities and differences. Then the results are compared to develop a video game for PUDCAD for the fourth workshop in the alpha stage for further studies. Questions and the workshop methods are then revised for the next student workshop. This research is hoped to inform game designers and teachers to find the most efficient method to educate and have a better understanding of inclusive design principles.",NULL,NULL

83,"Towards a Framework for Adaptive Gameplay in Serious Games that Teach Programming: Association Between Computational Thinking and Cognitive Style","Learning basic programming principles is the main process to acquire computational thinking skills, which comprise an essential capability for education worldwide. The game-based learning approach is a very promising learning strategy towards that direction. Digital games help learners become active and engaging in the acquisition of knowledge. Though, the learning process is not always clear through serious games that teach programming. Personality characteristics like cognitive style, seem to affect how efficiently and effectively learners perceive the knowledge. Cognitive style deals with the way learners perceive information and is a significant feature in improving programming learning. Thus, in order learners to achieve better performances through serious games that teach programming concepts, we need to investigate how cognitive style can be incorporated into the design of game-based learning environments. This article proposes a framework for adaptive gameplay that can support and encourage researchers and game designers to properly identify the concept of cognitive style when designing game-based learning environments for programming learning. The framework models an ontology that searches personality traits and enables personalised decision-making learning activities.",NULL,NULL
84,"C2ELT2S- A Competitive, Cooperative and Experiential Learning-Based Teamwork Training Strategy Game: Design and Proof of Concept","Playing provides many opportunities for learning as learners can take charge and make choices about their learning. However, since all play is not learning, it makes sense to combine learning and playing activities. In the area of teamwork training, despite the existence of a number of learning and leisure games, there is still room for a holistic approach to design such games. Thus, a game design is introduced based on well-proven and documented aspects of teamwork training. Based on this design, an initial proof of concept prototype is created and evaluated with 18 participants. The results are promising as the relationship between the prototype and teamwork was recognized, the prototypes training and playing potential was confirmed, and even its usability was rated as good. However, a more advanced prototype and artwork and a longer term study are required to further establish the training capabilities of the game design.",NULL,NULL
85,"Game Design in Financial Literacy: Exploring Design Patterns for a Collaborative and Inclusive Serious Game from Different Perspectives","The perspectives of teaching practitioners in the field of basic education/literacy and the perspective of theory-driven game-based learning are examined, and it is shown how collaborative problem-solving can be fostered and assessed in a serious game for financial literacy. Game-based learning has the potential for an inclusive learner target group. At the same time, the design process of a specific serious game is based on the instructional approach of anchored instruction on the one hand and constructivist learning theories on the other hand. The design principles from practitioners were identified through document analysis, and the designed serious game has been structured along game-based learning design elements. To foster the cognitive and social component of collaborative problem-solving, a twenty-first-century skill, these streams were linked. Therefore, the contribution suggests a trialogue with nonplaying characters to foster and assess collaborative problem-solving. The presented serious game is innovative as it was developed along the design-based research approach, where scientists and practitioners collaborate. Further research needs to be done regarding the implementation of the modified serious game in basic education/literacy courses.",NULL,NULL

107,"A comparison between expert and beginner learning for motor skill development in a virtual reality serious game","In order to be used for skill development and skill maintenance, virtual environments require accurate simulation of the physical phenomena involved in the process of the task being trained. The accuracy needs to be conveyed in a multimodal fashion with varying parameterisations still being quantified, and these are a function of task, prior knowledge, sensory efficacy and human perception. Virtual reality (VR) has been integrated from a didactic perspective in many serious games and shown to be effective in the pedological process. This paper interrogates whether didactic processes introduced into a VR serious game, by taking advantage of augmented virtuality to modify game attributes, can be effective for both beginners and experts to a task. The task in question is subjective performance in a clay pigeon shooting simulation. The investigation covers whether modified game attributes influence skill and learning in a complex motor task and also investigates whether this process is applicable to experts as well as beginners to the task. VR offers designers and developers of serious games the ability to provide information in the virtual world in a fashion that is impossible in the real world. This introduces the question of whether this is effective and transfers skill adoption into the real world and also if a-priori knowledge influences the practical nature of this information in the pedagogic process. Analysis is conducted via a between-subjects repeated measure ANOVA using a $$2 \times 2$$ 2  2 factorial design to address these questions. The results show that the different training provided affects the performance in this task ( $$N=57$$ N = 57 ). The skill improvement is still evidenced in repeated measures when information and guidance is removed. This effect does not exist under a control condition. Additionally, we separate by an expert and non-expert group to deduce if a-priori knowledge influences the effect of the presented information, it is shown that it does not.",NULL,NULL
108,"Virtual Reality Application for Relieving the Pain of Child Dental Patients","In this paper we develop an application that eases the anxiety of the child dentistry patients by taking them into a virtual environment. This virtual environment is a friendly and calming place, thus making it possible to minimize the pain and hard-ship caused by the dental procedures. The main aim of this study is to improve the user experience and usability elements of previous research with the use of a new technology (virtual reality). The main restriction of the application is the fact that the user has to stay still in the dental unit, since the child patient is not allowed to give a verbal input or use a controller during a treatment procedure. It can be dangerous for the child to move his/her head during treatment, therefore novel techniques are adapted to overcome these issues and create a user-friendly application. The movement restriction makes it possible to work with a three degrees of freedom VR headset, which is the most affordable type and can be easily purchased by dentists. One crucial part of this study is the animation in the beginning of the application intended to calm down the children as much as possible. Friendly characters with realistic and appropriate movements will be created and 3D modeled. A fun and playful scenario with an educational dialog is designed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown so that in future practical virtual experience applications will be adopted by many dentists to make their jobs easier with the patients.",NULL,NULL

Digitalization of analogue serious games based on player interaction is an arduous task requiring a substantial rethinking of the relationship between players, the facilitator(s), the game, and technology. Empirical research on the matter is inadequate, leaving practitioners without proper guidance in carrying out the digitalization process. This paper presents a novel framework, called the Participant Centred Framework, that can aid in moving from the analogue to the digital medium. The framework consists of several categories of relationships we believe instrumental in reimagining games for the digital realm. For each of these categories, several factors or topics to consider are included. The Participant Centred Framework is presented alongside a detailing of what we learned during our own, iterative digitalization process  mapped to the categories and factors of the framework.",NULL,NULL

The rate of relapse and dropout alcohol addiction treatment shows the necessity to improve those treatments. It is often caused by a lack of motivation or boredom. Cue exposure therapy is an effective treatment that tries to prevent relapses, but it has too many flaws preventing a global inhibition of the addiction. Virtual reality exposure therapy improves cue exposure therapy by using a virtual environment, that way the treatment is less situation-dependent by controlling a virtual world and its context. Serious games are used to address problems that we can find in more classical ways of learning such as motivation and boredom. It also allows the patient to have more active participation. This new approach aims to combine virtual reality exposure therapy, and action-centered exposure therapy, with a serious game to avoid dropout and have better self-commitment from patients.

The most common cognitive training adopted in substance use disorder can be clustered in two classes and has been here described in parallel with their neurocognitive findings: Cognitive Bias Modification and response inhibition training, which have shown to operate via reorientation of stimulusaction approach biases and rewiring of the medial Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) and the amygdala; Working Memory and Goal Management interventions, which have been associated with improvements in stimulusoutcome representations, for example, increased future-based delay-discounting and decision-making, and rewiring of the dorsolateral and ventral PFC. The use and efficacy data of these four cognitive training programmes in behavioural addictions are still missing. The combination of various neuroscience-informed interventions that synergistically tap into bottom-up versus top-down cognitive processes, together with phenotype-matched cognitive approaches for precision medicine, are two intriguing emerging approaches for finding the best way to empower EFs in addiction.",NULL,NULL

However, virtual environments including virtual simulations and serious games, and the human-computer interface more generally, have focused on the visual and auditory senses. Simulating the other senses such as the sense of smell (olfaction) can be beneficial for supporting learning. In this paper we present a simple and cost-effective olfactory interface constructed using an Arduino Uno microcontroller board, a small fan, an off-the-shelf air freshener to deliver scents to a user of a serious game. A fuzzy logic system regulated the amount of scent delivered to the user based on their distance to the display. As a proof-of-concept, we developed a serious game intended to teach basic math (counting) skills to children. Learners (players) collect pineapples from the scene and then enter the amount of pineapples collected. As the pineapples are collected, a pineapple scent is emitted from the olfactory interface thus serving to supplement or complement the learners senses and stimulate their affection and cognition.

Technology is progressively more used to support innovative teaching that allows young people to acquire new skills to meet the needs of the changing labor market. The study describes a participative research and co-design work realized into seven Italian high schools in the agricultural, construction and manufacturing sectors, to co-create an educational tool (videogame) in order to promote occupational safety and health (OSH). The study applied qualitative and quantitative methods to facilitate the participation and the engagement of teachers and students. Learning by playing has always been an activity, today technologies and gaming can offer cognitive and operational elements suitable for recognizing and therefore preventing the occupational risks.",NULL,NULL
121,"Introducing Gamification in Professional Training","The incorporation of game elements in non-game contexts is a subject of interest in various sectors, such as business, marketing, engineering, medicine, and military. Gamification and serious games have been involved in the rapid adaptation of professional training. The main goal of game thinking is to motivate and engage learners by using game-like techniques. This paper introduces gamification as an innovative approach for police officers to develop the required competencies for upholding the ethics, principles, and values that the Ecuadorian institution and society demand of them. The aim of gamification is to improve the quality and efficiency of the transfer from theory to real-life practice in police training. The paper focuses on the use of technology in a gamified virtual learning environment that simulates scenarios based upon common incidents reported to Ecuadorian police. The evaluation was conducted with 50 police officers. Our initial evaluation demonstrates that gamification has the potential to be scaled to force-wide proportions.",NULL,NULL

126,"RoboTIC: A serious game based on augmented reality for learning programming","Coding skills are becoming more and more important in todays world, especially within the context of the fourth industrial revolution. They also help practice other 21 century skills such as computational thinking, problem solving and teamwork. Unfortunately, learning how to program is tough and can be also frustrating for beginner students. In this work we introduce RoboTIC, a serious game based on gamification and Augmented Reality that facilitates the learning of programming to students in lower levels of the education system by using a novel set of visual metaphors derived from a notation of roads and traffic signs. The architecture that supports RoboTIC has been designed to allow the integration of multimedia components when new programming concepts and techniques must be addressed and to add game levels that enable students to learn incrementally. Experiments have been conducted in a youth center with children who do not have coding skills at all to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposal. The results show promising conclusions in terms of childrens motivation and interest in programming.",NULL,NULL
127,"Can Leisure Become a Place Generator? Exploring the Idea through Stebbinss Serious Leisure Perspective","It is surprising that only now leisure studies are starting to look at the importance of the physical environment (i.e. natural and built environments). Recently, an increasing number of research studies were conducted on leisure and space but most, if not all, were unidirectional, meaning that they only observed the influence of place on leisure. Consequently, research regarding the impact of leisure on place has been scarce. Specifically, this paper presents the concept of place and how it is understood in the field of geography. Using Stebbinss Serious Leisure Perspective (SLP), this paper: (1) examines how leisure can be a generator of place, (2) illustrates Stebbinss SLP and the three types of leisure it contains, and (3) demonstrates how serious leisure has the ability to generate place and culture.",NULL,NULL
128,"Serious Leisure Visual Artists in Israel: Challenging Amateurism","This study investigates amateurish visual artists and their work, exhibited at the Upper-Floor Gallery (UFG) at the Memorial Center of Kiryat Tivon, Israel. Out of thirty such artists, three were found to form a sub-category - the challengers, due to the ways they challenge boundaries within the art world. All UFG artists were studied both through in-depth interviews and through their artwork, and were defined as serious-leisure artists, instead of simply amateurs (Marnin-Distelfeld and Dorchin 2020 ) according to the theory of Serious-Leisure-Perspective (Stebbins 2015 ). The challengers can be differentiated from the rest of the group, having succeeded in developing their artistic performance and exhibiting their art in venues beyond peripheral galleries, and by better understanding the art scene in general. Two have a partly relevant academic background in art or art-related studies, which contributes to their artistic choices. Their art possesses three crucial properties, which also characterize professional art: it is semantically unstable and complex in meaning, it deals with socio-political issues present in contemporary cultural discourse and it is made of mixed media, with original combinations of materials and techniques. All three characteristics embody an artistic approach compatible with current curation trends, thus placing the challengers away from amateurism and closer to professionalism.",NULL,NULL
129,"A framework to design vocabulary-based serious games for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)","The use of serious games to help children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) learn different skills has increased in the recent past. Games, however, have not been exploited to enhance the vocabulary of these children. The serious game design framework (SGDF) and its components provide support throughout the design process, but there are no existing SGDFs that can be used to design serious games for these children to learn vocabulary skills. Therefore, in this research, a SGDF is proposed to overcome the problem of designing serious games for children with ASD. The components of the framework were identified after an extensive review of the literature on ASD and existing SGDFs. The input, process and output model was used as an underlying structure of the framework, and the identified components were logically placed in each phase of the model. The proposed framework was iteratively evaluated through expert reviews with academic experts and researchers working in the area of serious games, as well as game designers. The modified version of the framework was produced based on the comments provided by experts. This modified version was then used in the applicability evaluation of the framework with researchers and game designers. A proposed SGDF was produced based on the comments of experts. The main findings from expert reviews show that the structure, components and details of the proposed framework have been effectively refined. The use of the framework to produce serious game design and the prototype demonstrates its use in real time. The evaluation of the prototype with autistic children shows the improvement in their vocabulary learning before and after using the prototype.",NULL,NULL
130,"Development of virtual reality rehabilitation games for children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder","Balance and coordination exercises improve the attention of children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and exercise-based game treatments are effective in training childrens balance control and coordination and improving their cognition and intelligence. This study used immersive virtual reality exercise games as an intervention in rehabilitation to improve the attention, cognitive ability, abstract reasoning, and complex information processing of children with ADHD. This study is comprised of two stages: In the first stage, we interviewed experts in rehabilitation, made observations of rehabilitation sessions for children with ADHD, and developed three games focusing on training body coordination. In the second stage, we used the HTC VIVE (HTC, Taiwan), a virtual reality game console, in a 3-month training program developed for children with ADHD. We compared childrens attention, cognitive ability, abstract reasoning, and complex information processing before and after this program. The results revealed that children with ADHD improved their performance in attention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and oppositional defiance. Our results may serve as a reference for the clinical use of technological assistive devices in rehabilitation as well as for families, schools, and rehabilitation institutes in implementing daily training and rehabilitation programs for children with ADHD.",NULL,NULL
131,"Immersive Virtual Environments and Wearable Haptic Devices in rehabilitation of children with neuromotor impairments: a single-blind randomized controlled crossover pilot study","Background The past decade has seen the emergence of rehabilitation treatments using virtual reality. One of the advantages in using this technology is the potential to create positive motivation, by means of engaging environments and tasks shaped in the form of serious games. The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of immersive Virtual Environments and weaRable hAptic devices (VERA) for rehabilitation of upper limb in children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) and Developmental Dyspraxia (DD). Methods A two period cross-over design was adopted for determining the differences between the proposed therapy and a conventional treatment. Eight children were randomized into two groups: one group received the VERA treatment in the first period and the manual therapy in the second period, and viceversa for the other group. Children were assessed at the beginning and the end of each period through both the Nine Hole Peg Test (9-HPT, primary outcome) and Kinesiological Measurements obtained during the performing of similar tasks in a real setting scenario (secondary outcomes). Results All subjects, not depending from which group they come from, significantly improved in both the performance of the 9-HPT and in the parameters of the kinesiological measurements (movement error and smoothness). No statistically significant differences have been found between the two groups. Conclusions These findings suggest that immersive VE and wearable haptic devices is a viable alternative to conventional therapy for improving upper extremity function in children with neuromotor impairments.

132,"Understanding students game experiences throughout the developmental process of the number navigation game","Serious games for learning have received increased attention in recent years. However, empirical studies on students gaming experiences throughout the developmental process of serious games and discussions regarding game design are missing. The aims of the present study were to analyze students gaming experiences while playing four consecutive versions of the Number Navigation Game (NNG)a mathematical game-based learning environment focusing on flexibility and adaptivity with whole-number arithmetic; and to provide an extensive review of the NNG developmental and design process over 3years with focus on how and why the design decisions were made, and how those choices affected students gaming experiences. The study employed a mixed-methods design of quantitative and qualitative research. The Game Experience Questionnaire about eight core game experience dimensions was answered by different groups of students at primary schools in Finland in three different experiments after students played four versions of the NNG from 2014 to 2016. Six semi structured interviews related to students game experiences, preferences and game features of the latest version of NNG were conducted. Overall, results indicate that improvement in games usability and clarity in the user interface has positive impacts on students game experiences. Furthermore, there seems to be a clear advantage in having better aesthetics and value in improving extrinsic elements that could contribute to maintain players enthusiasm and situational interest in serious games.",NULL,NULL
133,"A systematic review of gamification techniques applied to elderly care","The proportion of the worlds population growing older is rapidly increasing over the last decades. With the recent progresses seen in information and communication technologies, there have been great concerns about developing personalized healthcare services that can ensure the living conditions and active aging of the elderly people. Among these technologies, we highlight and review in this work, the current state of gamification and related techniques applied to the elderly care context. Six research questions were defined to provide an overview on the current state in the development of gamified systems for elderly care through the identification of publication source types, research areas, target groups, game design elements and technologies employed and observed issues and benefits of using gamification in this context. Results have shown a great diversity in publication source types and research areas, even within the health domain. Different target groups were identified based on surrounding environment and physical and cognitive capabilities of the elderly person. Feedback, progression, rewards and social interaction enhancement are highlighted as the most relevant and frequently used game design elements for this context. Technological features observed include self-management systems, portable devices, physical robots, consoles and wearable technologies. The use of gamification techniques to support elderly people has proven to be beneficial to improve wellbeing as well as both physical, cognitive, social, and emotional state of the elderly person. Current challenges are most related with the need for traditional healthcare services to integrate gamification techniques to improve personalized healthcare and answer different necessities and adapt the support provided according to the individual capabilities of elderly people. The findings presented in this systematic literature review should be considered in the development of future personalized elderly care solutions by adapting the support provided according to interests, capabilities, necessities and contexts associated to the elderly person as a means to improve independence, health and wellbeing, capture interest and positive engagement, facilitate social interaction and decrease impact of many different medical conditions affecting older people.",NULL,NULL
134,"MANTRA: development and localization of a mobile educational health game targeting low literacy players in low and middle income countries","Background Mobile technology is increasingly important for delivering public health interventions to remote populations. This research study developed, piloted, and assessed a serious game for mobile devices that teaches geohazard, maternal, and neonatal health messages. This unique mHealth intervention aimed at low-literacy audiences in low resource settings is part of the Maternal and Neonatal Technologies in Rural Areas (MANTRA) project: Increasing maternal and child health resilience before, during, and after disasters using mobile technology in Nepal. Methods The serious game was developed through a co-creation process between London and Kathmandu based researchers by email and video-calling, and face-to-face with local stakeholders in Nepal. The process identified core needs, developed appropriate pictograms and mechanics, and tailored the pilot serious game to the local cultural context. Evaluations and feedback from end users took place in rural villages and suburban Kathmandu in Province Three. Field evaluation sessions used mixed methods. Researchers observed game play and held focus group discussions to elicit qualitative feedback and understand engagement, motivation, and usability, and conducted a paired pre- and post-game knowledge assessment. Results The MANTRA serious game is contextualized to rural Nepal. The game teaches 28 learning objectives in three modules: maternal health, neonatal health, and geohazards, through picture matching with immediate audio and visual feedback. User feedback from focus groups demonstrated high engagement, motivation, and usability of the game. Conclusions This MANTRA study is a unique mHealth intervention of a serious game to teach core health and geohazards messages to low-literacy audiences in rural Nepal. Although the mobile game is tailored for this specific context, the developmental process and insights could be transferable to the development of other games-based interventions and contextualized for any part of the world. Successfully targeting this low-literacy and illiterate audience makes the MANTRA development process the first of its kind and a novel research endeavor with potential for widespread impact and adoption following further game development.

135,"Investigating Navigational Behavior Patterns of Students Across At-Risk Categories Within an Open-Ended Serious Game","An open-ended serious game can engage students scientific problem-solving processes. However, understanding how students learn higher-order thinking skills through solving a problem in an open-ended game system is a challenge. The complex game systems may make learning more difficult for students with different characteristics such as an at-risk label. Recent research stresses the importance of using gameplay data to better understand diverse individuals learning behaviors and performances in the context of serious games. We analyzed gameplay data of a serious game called Alien Rescue to identify navigation behavior patterns between at-risk and non-at-risk middle school students. Particularly, we incorporated the combination of lag sequential analysis and sequential pattern mining in statistical analyses. The results revealed that the non-at-risk and at-risk students used problem-solving strategies differently when they navigated the environment. The findings using this integrated method confirmed that additional support was needed for at-risk students in order for them to develop contextual and procedural knowledge for problem-solving in the game environment. The findings provide methodological guidelines for researchers considering a sequential analysis as well as offer practical guidelines for game designers to consider when designing serious games with a complex problem so as to help at-risk students.",NULL,NULL

137,"PyDiophantus maze game: Play it to learn mathematics or implement it to learn game programming in Python","Serious games or educational games have attracted the interest of instructors and researchers for several years. In the field of education, serious games are being used for motivating students, attracting their interest in cognitively demanding fields and making the teaching and learning process more fun. Moreover, learning through implementing games has been proposed as an effective alternative to the traditional instructor-centered approach to teaching programming. Towards this direction the study presented in this article aims to investigate whether it is feasible to learn programming concepts, as well as game programming concepts, through implementing a game in Python. More specifically, the study presented has the following goals: firstly, to review and comparatively analyze existing game engines and libraries that can be used by novice programmers for implementing simple games in Python; secondly, to investigate whether it is feasible to implement a simple but yet meaningful game that can be used as a prototype for learning programming concepts and game programming concepts in Python. In order to reach the second goal a serious game was implemented as a case study, using the free and open source Python library of pygame that based on the aforementioned comparative analysis is appropriate for novices. The PyDiophantus Maze game that was implemented can be used for teaching and learning game programming in Python, but also for learning mathematics.

Despite the importance of both skills in the reading comprehension and overall learning, a limited number of studies have been found. These include seven studies on language comprehension and seven studies on decoding. The shortlisted studies were analysed and a very limited number of modalities were found to have been used; text, graphics, audio, video, and mouse movement are used in all the studies and are termed basic modalities. Statistical analysis was also conducted on three parameters: (1) outcome of the study; (2) generalisation; and (3) maintenance. The analysis showed that CBIs were effective in facilitating these childrens learning; there was a significant improvement in the performance of children from the baseline to during and the post-intervention period. The analysis of generalisation has revealed positive results, indicating that the children were able to transfer information to a different setting or situation. Positive results are also noted from the analysis of maintenance, which indicate that the children retained information following the withdrawal of intervention. The combination of teachers instructions and CBI has provided better results than using either of them separately. This study has discovered 23 potential modalities and 2 potential CBIs including serious games and virtual learning environments that can be explored for language comprehension and decoding skills.",NULL,NULL
139,"For Whom the Games Toll: A Qualitative and Intergenerational Evaluation of What is Serious in Games for Older Adults","The aim of this study was to engage older adults in discussions about digital serious games. Using a qualitative exploratory approach, we report observations from more than 100h of conversations with individuals in the age range 6590, in a study entitled Finding better games for older adults (June 2017December 2019). Phase 1 (19 older participants, 3 young research students) involved conversations around a quantitative study of cognitive benefits of digital playing (minimum 6h/person). Phases 2 and 3 involved a focus group in the form of a community class (10weeks, 2h per meeting), involving introduction to digital game genres, playing, and discussing motivations and obstacles for current and future play. Cognitive stimulation, emotional distraction and physical therapy were initially stated as the motives for game play. However, with growing familiarity and voluntary exchanges of personal stories between older and younger participants, the cultural significance of the medium of game (especially with story-telling and VR technology) became more important to older adults. More than mechanical inaccessibility, lack of access to the cultural discourse about games presents barriers for older adults. To create a safe, comfortable and accessible space for intergenerational learning and play is of primary importance both for users and designers, should serious games be considered for the future of digital care.",NULL,NULL
140,"Fueling Prediction of Player Decisions: Foundations of Feature Engineering for Optimized Behavior Modeling in Serious Games","As a digital learning medium, serious games can be powerful, immersive educational vehicles and provide large data streams for understanding player behavior. Educational data mining and learning analytics can effectively leverage big data in this context to heighten insight into student trajectories and behavior profiles. In application of these methods, distilling event-stream data down to a set of salient features for analysis (i.e. feature engineering) is a vital element of robust modeling. This paper presents a process for systematic game-based feature engineering to optimize insight into player behavior: the IDEFA framework (Integrated Design of Event-stream Features for Analysis). IDEFA aligns game design and data collection for high-resolution feature engineering, honed through critical, iterative interplay with analysis. Building on recent research in game-based data mining, we empirically investigate IDEFA application in serious games. Results show that behavioral models which used a full feature set produced more meaningful results than those with no feature engineering, with greater insight into impactful learning interactions, and play trajectories characterizing groups of players. This discovery of emergent player behavior is fueled by the data framework, resultant base data stream, and rigorous feature creation process put forward in IDEFAintegrating iterative design, feature engineering, and analysis for optimal insight into serious play.",NULL,NULL
141,"Hospital-to-Home Transition for Older Patients: Using Serious Games to Improve the Motivation for Rehabilitation a Qualitative Study","Traditional physiotherapy is often perceived as repetitive and boring by patients, leading to issues in maintaining their interest and performing the required exercises. This paper investigates older patients engagement and motivation for physical activity using a serious game-based rehabilitation compared to a control group using a standard care therapy, during hospitalization. We conducted a randomized clinical trial with 57 geriatric patients and demonstrated that the serious game-based rehabilitation was as efficient as the standard rehabilitation program in terms of improving their functional capacity. In this paper, we mainly focus on reporting qualitative analysis of the patients behavior change thorough the intervention. The intervention lasted 3weeks. Semi-structured interviews, including all the participants, were conducted before and after the intervention. Patients attitudes towards rehabilitation process, physical activity and innovation technology were investigated. Motivation to be active following the intervention were explored. Participants admitted feeling bored at the hospital and only following along the care process routine. Enthusiasm towards the progress brought by technological solution was observed. At the end of the hospital stay, the serious game-based rehabilitation received positive feedback. Patients felt more active and observed significant improvement of their general condition. The analysis suggests that patients participating in the gamified rehabilitation are more motivated. Several recommendations on designing serious game for elderly rehabilitation are proposed.",NULL,NULL
142,"Practical Functional Assessment: A Case Study Replication and Extension with a Child Diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder","Recent literature has described the analysis and treatment of problem behavior that involves an open-ended interview to inform the conditions under which problem behavior is likely to occur, conducting a synthesized contingency analysis, and implementing treatment that includes functional communication training, delay and denial tolerance training, and increasing the amount of demands presented after a denial (e.g., Hanley et al. Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis , 47 (1), 1636, 2014 ). This process has been described as an Interview-Informed Synthesized Contingency Analysis (IISCA) or practical functional assessment. Much of the literature evaluating the practical functional assessment has originated from authors within the same research group. The purpose of the present study was to replicate and extend previous research on the practical functional assessment with a different group of researchers and in a different setting (i.e., an early intensive behavioral intervention clinic). This study sought to extend previous literature by including additional measures of social validity on the open-ended interview, contingency analysis, treatment, and pre-post measures on parental stress.

To empower Millennial learners to take control of their own learning, a single-player, unguided web-based Neonatal Resuscitation Game was designed. The present study investigates the effectiveness of the game on retention of resuscitation knowledge and skills. Methods The study evaluated 162 healthcare professionals who attended simulation-based training in neonatal resuscitation. Following standard simulation-based training, participants were assigned to either a gaming group (Gamers) with access to the web-based Neonatal Resuscitation Game or a control group (Controls) with no access to the game. Although Gamers were given access, game utilization was completely voluntary and at will. Some Gamers chose to utilize the web-based game (Players) and others did not (Non-players). Knowledge and skills in neonatal resuscitation were assessed upon completion of training and 6months post-training using a multiple-choice question test and a manikin-based skills test. Changes in scores were compared statistically between Gamers vs Controls, Players vs Controls, and Players vs Controls + Non-players using two-sample t-tests. Results At the final assessment, declines in knowledge scores were seen in all groups. Mean change from baseline in knowledge and skill performance scores at 6months, adjusted for baseline skill performance and MCQ test scores, did not differ significantly between Players vs Controls and Players vs Controls + Non-players. Conclusion The web-based game in its current format may not be effective in facilitating retention of knowledge and technical skills in neonatal resuscitation.",NULL,NULL

146,"Student-centred digital gamebased learning: a conceptual framework and survey of the state of the art","Student-centred learning forms a major driver behind educational policy and practice in the modern day. With a drive towards embracing the possibilities of technology within the classroom, especially digital video games, it is vital to have an understanding of where such games are delivering and where their potential has yet to be explored. With this in mind, it is important to survey the existing literature to establish the level to which the promise of student-centred learning is being delivered through digital video games. This study presents a conceptual framework based upon a systematic literature review of developments in student-centred digital gamebased learning, and seeks to establish the extent to which all tenets of student-centred learning and principles of digital gamebased learning are embraced within such applications. A thematic analysis identifies the common themes of game and intervention design while integrating and conceptually linking the key concepts of student-centred learning and digital gamebased learning. This leads to the development of a conceptual framework allowing classification of the literature according to common themes. Inclusion criteria include the presence of student-centred learning concepts, with a game-based focus including specifically digital video games. Inclusion was limited to papers published since 2007. The literature analysis identifies a number of themes; these were primarily the types of player engagement: single player , mixed and multiplayer , along with principles of game design and the key tenets of student-centred learning . A preponderance of games and interventions utilising single player experiences and focusing on implementing the active learning tenet of student-centred learning were observed. Areas relating to multiplayer engagements and the social aspects of student-centred learning such as mutual respect receive comparatively less attention in games and research. In order to fully embrace the possibilities offered by student-centred digital gamebased learning, it is important not to neglect lessons learned in the development of student-centred learning to its current state. Aspects such as peer-based learning and building relationships between students and teachers have been found important in traditional learning and must be investigated and adapted to new media, including games, as new technologies enter the educational mainstream. Further research into the effects of designing games around these multiplayer aspects, and better defining the role of teachers and educational staff in digital gamebased learning, may demonstrate ways to develop and create educational experiences that better engage and prepare students.",NULL,NULL
147,"PenQuest: a gamified attacker/defender meta model for cyber security assessment and education","Attacks on IT systems are a rising threat against the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical information and infrastructures. At the same time, the complex interplay of attack techniques and possible countermeasures makes it difficult to appropriately plan, implement, and evaluate an organizations defense. More often than not, the worlds of technical threats and organizational controls remain disjunct. In this article, we introduce PenQuest, a meta model designed to present a complete view on information system attacks and their mitigation while providing a tool for both semantic data enrichment and security education. PenQuest simulates time-enabled attacker/defender behavior as part of a dynamic, imperfect information multi-player game that derives significant parts of its ruleset from established information security sources such as STIX, CAPEC, CVE/CWE and NISTSP800-53. Attack patterns, vulnerabilities, and mitigating controls are mapped to counterpart strategies and concrete actions through practical, data-centric mechanisms. The gamified model considers and defines a wide range of actors, assets, and actions, thereby enabling the assessment of cyber risks while giving technical experts the opportunity to explore specific attack scenarios in the context of an abstracted IT infrastructure. We implemented PenQuest as a physical serious game prototype and successfully tested it in a higher education environment. Additional expert interviews helped evaluate the models applicability to information security scenarios.",NULL,NULL

The aim is to increase patient engagement during physiotherapy by motivating the user to participate in a game. The proposed sensor node attached on the lower limb provides input to the gamified experience displayed on an Android mobile device, offering feedback to the patient in relation to whether the performed exercises were accurately conducted. A classification algorithm is proposed that automatically classifies an exercise in real-time as correct or incorrect, according to physiotherapists set criteria. The game projects a graphical image of the patients limb motion as part of a 3D computer graphics scene. It then classifies the exercise performed during physiotherapy as accurately performed or not and increases patient compliance via a reward system. Our goal is to reduce the need for the physical presence of a physiotherapist by aiding the efficient performance of exercise sessions at any location, e.g. at home, indoors and outdoors by just utilizing a light sensor and an Android device. Initial testing of the application in the Chanias General Hospital Orthopaedic Clinic, Greece, indicates that patient engagement is enhanced in most cases, even when elderly patients are concerned.",NULL,NULL

161,"Simplifying the Validation and Application of Games with Simva","The suitability of games for learning has been proven for many years. However, effective application of games in education requires two important stages: their initial validation, and their later use in the classroom. Serious games should be validated prior to exploitation to prove their efficacy and usefulness as tools for teachers, via larger experiments that include data collection, either from in-game interactions or from external questionnaires; this, in turn, requires dealing with data privacy regulations and informed consent. Once validated, serious games can then be applied in educational environments, where their effective application is closely linked to the tools and preparation available to the teachers and educators that use them. In this paper, we revise the steps and considerations that need to be dealt with both when conducting experiments with games and, later, when applying them as part of teaching in educational scenarios. For both these stages, we provide guidance and recommendations to simplify stakeholders tasks, including the use of the tool Simva , which simplifies the management of users, questionnaires, privacy, data collection, and storage.",NULL,NULL
162,"Optimized User Experience Design for Augmentative and Alternative Communication via Mobile Technology: Using Gamification to Enhance Access and Learning for Users with Severe Autism","One of the most significant disabilities in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) includes a delay in, or total lack of, the development of spoken language. Approximately half of those on the autism spectrum are functionally non-verbal or minimally verbal and will not develop sufficient natural speech or writing to meet their daily communication needs. These individuals receive intervention in the area of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) using mobile technologies. AAC services ideally should be provided starting at an early age but many young learners experience some degree of difficulty in gross and fine motor functioning that prevents accessing and benefitting from mobile AAC applications. A suite of evidence-based iPhone  applications, SPEAKall! Lite  and SPEAKplay!  , was developed to help learners with ASD (a) acquire initial speech and language skills, and (b) train critical gestures needed to fully access mobile touch screen devices. SPEAKplay! trains the performance of gestures including Directed and Sustained Touch, Drag and Drop, and Vertical and Horizontal Swipe through a gamification approach.

170,"Accessibility and Serious Games: What About Entity-Component-System Software Architecture?","Video games are an integral part of popular culture. The video game industry faces challenges with the increase in players numbers and application areas including serious games. The increase in the number of players includes disabled players. Therefore, serious games have to consider these audiences who may be affected by one or more temporary or ongoing disabilities. Universally accessible games (UA-Games) aim to create interfaces that can be accessed and manipulated by the largest number of players. Currently few serious games include accessibility features, while accessibility should be considered at the beginning of the serious game design. Then how can we help designers and developers to include accessible features in an existing serious game? To this end, game engines must be efficient but also scalable and modular. This paper studies the interest of the Entity-Component-System (ECS) software architecture to integrate accessibility features in an existing serious game. As a case study, we will take a serious game developed with ECS yet not accessible: E-LearningScape. We will present the accessible features that we have integrated into the serious game and discuss the pros and cons of this approach. This feedback shows us that ECS provides very useful design flexibility to integrate unanticipated interaction features into serious games.",NULL,NULL
171,"Collect the Bones, Avoid the Cones: A Game-Based App for Public Engagement","Game-based applications (apps) and serious games enable educationalists to teach complex life sciences topics. Gamification principles (i.e. challenges, problem solving, critical thinking) improve learners motivation and can also help science communicators discuss important scientific subjects and their real-world context in an effective, enjoyable manner. The aim of this study was to design, develop and evaluate a science communication game-based app, entitled Collect the Bones, Avoid the Cones, on human skull anatomy for use in public engagement activities with younger audiences. Specifically, the app contextualised three-dimensional (3D) skull anatomy within a narrative about cycling and helmet safety. The app was tested at the Glasgow Science Centre, with ethical approval from the Glasgow School of Art, to assess its potential pedagogical value, in terms of pre- and post-app knowledge and confidence, and general user evaluation. In total, 50 participants were recruited (mean age 15.61.647, range 764) with 62% of participants aged 712. Usability and educational value were rated highly with 70% of participants agreeing they could use the app without any external instructions and 90% agreeing they understand the anatomy of the skull better after app use. The enjoyability of the game was also positively perceived with 94% of participants agreeing they enjoyed the game. Although there was no statistical significance in pre- and post-app knowledge scores, there was a statistically significant increase in players confidence relating to skull anatomy (pre-app: 3.001.265, post-app: 4.001.00, Z =5.111, p <0.001). These results provide promising insight into the potential of game-based apps for public engagement in anatomical sciences.

177,"A Game-Based Service to Mitigate the Risk of Inundations Caused by Solid Waste Accumulation","The number of people living in metropolitan areas of Mexico has steadily grown over the last decades. However, a lack of proper regulations has led to various consequences. An example of this is the mishandling of solid waste. A 2018 study reported that, in our country, 27% of solid waste remains in the cities, and only 12% is recycled. For that reason, garbage accumulation on urban areas is an environmental concern. To address this problem, a law for the management of waste was promulgated. Nevertheless, despite government efforts, the issue continues to aggravate with time. Another dilemma that affects our territory is that many regions are flood-prone. Together, solid waste and seasonal floods result in blockages of the drainage systems in cities, which in turn leads to the stagnation of large amounts of water and inundations. To mitigate the risk of inundations caused by solid waste accumulation, we developed a game-based service. The name of the ludic tool that we developed for this purpose is Wood of War: a pervasive, mobile serious game that motivates players to register places with a high concentration of solid waste. The service works as follows: first, we contrast game-generated registers with information of rainwater flow to determine high-risk zones and to create heat maps; then, we present the maps to the corresponding (local) authorities, so that they may optimize their garbage collecting efforts. To explore the viability of our approach, we tested our service in a pilot study. Additionally, we conducted interviews with government officials to learn their impressions. In this chapter, we present a summary of the results, a discussion of the benefits and limitations of our project, and our plans to consolidate the service.",NULL,NULL
178,"Tales of Etrya: English Vocabulary Game","Video games are an adequate tool for teaching and learning since they are engaging, motivating and meet new generation preferences and needs. Consequently, video games may be a suitable strategy to use when learning vocabulary of a second language. However, this is only possible when players are in constant practice and interested in playing. Furthermore, attractive aesthetics improve the quality of the game and makes it more compelling to players. In this paper, the first level of Tales of Etrya (ToE) is presented. ToE is a user-centred mobile game focused on teaching English vocabulary in context. Additionally, we present an optimisation technique based on Level of Detail (LOD) and Culling Optimisation to achieve an acceptable performance in mobile devices. The game was validated with English teachers and tested by a group of students for validation purposes using the Player Experience Inventory (PXI). Our findings show positive results regarding important aspects for the students motivation such as interest, immersion, aesthetics and game performance.

One of the aspects linked to this phenomenon is the motivation achieved with the activities offered in them. On the other hand, there is another technology that has been growing for some time now, which are the Virtual Learning and Teaching Environments (VLTEs). These environments allow carrying out various activities and usually include self-assessment. In this article, we analyze the use of the serious mobile game Desafiate, aimed at student self-assessment and integrated into the IDEAS VLTE. The analysis is based on the intrinsic motivation achieved when using this game, compared to other methods used for self-assessment. Three contrasting groups are used for the analysis  one of them uses the serious game, another one uses pen and paper for their self-assessment, and the third one uses the IDEAS VTLE (and its assessment tool). As an instrument to measure intrinsic motivation, the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) questionnaire is used. This questionnaire considers utility, perceived usefulness, pressure/tension, and effort during the activity as variables that affect motivation, among other factors that are not contemplated in this work. Results show that students value self-assessment as a useful activity, and they have shown greater interest in this process when working with Desafiate.",NULL,NULL

This is the world of wicked problems, of which the situation triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic is a notable example. Wicked problems are complex scenarios defined by the interplay of multiple environmental, social and economic factors. They are everchanging, and largely unpredictable and uncontrollable. As a consequence, wicked problems cannot be definitively solved through traditional problem-solving approaches. Instead, they should be iteratively managed, recognizing and valuing our connectedness with each other and the environment, and engaging in joint thinking and action to identify and pursue the common good. Serious games can be key to foster wicked problem management abilities. To this end, they should engage players in collective activities set in contexts simulating real-world wicked problem scenarios. These should require the continuous interpretation of changing circumstances to identify and pursue shared goals, promoting the development of knowledge, attitudes and skill sets relevant to tackle real-world situations. In this paper we outline the nature, implications and challenges of wicked problems, highlighting why games should be leveraged to foster wicked problem management abilities. Then, we propose a theory-based framework to support the design of games for this purpose.",NULL,NULL
184,"A Serious Game on Skull Anatomy for Dental Undergraduates","Knowledge of the anatomy of the skull and its bones forms an important part of the understanding required for the study and practice of safe clinical dentistry. The use of serious games in healthcare education is well-documented, but there is comparatively little evidence for their use in dental education. Intrinsically integrated rewards are a game mechanic that can be motivational for serious game users. A research gap was identified in the delivery of skull anatomy education to dental undergraduate students via a serious game with intrinsically integrated rewards. A serious game, titled Visualisation Studio Sim , was developed with Unity, featuring three-dimensional models and assets designed and modified with 3dsMax and Instant Meshes. Two versions of the game were built, one with the addition of intrinsically integrated rewards and one without it, and the game versions were tested by a convenience sample to gather open-ended feedback on the usability and suitability of the game mechanic for dental undergraduate education. Feedback suggested that it was straightforward to interact with the skull models but that the rewards were not as well integrated into the flow and immersion of the game as intended, and the game might not have been as challenging as desired for the intended cohort warranting future refinements in these aspects.",NULL,NULL
185,"Cookie Mania: A Serious Game for Teaching Internet Cookies to High School and College Students","Internet cookies are data storage tools that collect information from a platforms users to inform various aspects of the platform such as marketing and recommendations systems. Notably, there is a lack of understanding around what internet cookies are and how they work, which spans from adolescents to adults. This can lead to major misunderstandings of how consenting information works in online mediums, and results in negative outcomes and effects for users by default. To help increase understanding of internet cookies and address these issues, we have developed a serious game called Cookie Mania . Our game aims to develop knowledge of internet cookies and related ethical issues through an interactive narrative, as well as foster additional engagement through cookie-focused minigames. In this demonstration paper, we discuss the design and development of Cookie Mania highlighting how the various design choices target learning objectives for internet cookies and their underlying ethical issues.",NULL,NULL
186,"Gamifying the Rice Industry: The Riceville Paradigm","The global agriculture industry remains underdeveloped due to a lack of education among farmers about best practices and technologies. Similarly, corporate gamification and the rise of serious games have demonstrated their effectiveness in education within our era. The implementation of gamification principles through accessible technological platforms has massive potential in building best practices in the agriculture industry. Rice agriculture has a resistance to the adoption of new methodologies and technologies. This paper introduces Riceville, a game used to simulate a virtual farming environment promoting the use of effective best-practices introduced by leading rice organisations like the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). By gamifying best practices, the social norms of low adoption and perception of risk can be altered to boost the reception of novel practices within the industry. This will not only serve to modernize the rice industry but also improve yields for farmers while helping agriculture companies increase exposure.",NULL,NULL
187,"Do Individual Differences Modulate the Effect of Agency on Learning Outcomes with a Serious Game?","In order to support and promote new ways of learning, educational technology should be based on sophisticated theories and models of learning. Many issues are raised in the current understanding of learning by the constant evolution of educational technology and the burgeoning of educational contexts using these technologies. By examining the relation between agency and learning gains using a Serious Game for learning Physics, the present study focuses on a main issue of technology use: whether actively playing the game or watching someone play is beneficial for learning. Thirty-seven dyads participated in the study. Randomly assigned, one participant played a Serious Educational Game for learning Physics, Mecanika (Boucher-Genesse et al. 2011 ), for 120min, while the other participant watched the players gameplay in real-time on a separate screen. As pretest and posttest, the Force Concept Inventory (FCI; Hestenes et al. 1992 ) was administered to measure learning gains in Physics. Analyses of answers on the FCI demonstrate that a Serious Game, such as Mecanika , is beneficial to learning, regardless if learning is conceived as relatively coarse shifts from wrong to good answers (scientific conceptions) or as more nuanced shifts from fillers/misconceptions to scientific conceptions. Also, individual differences in learning gains across dyads were found, which can be explained by the gameplay of a dyad created by the active player. Furthermore, the effect of agency is systematic and not modulated by individual differences: watchers learn more than players. These results need to be further explained by modeling the learning process.",NULL,NULL
188,"Two Years After: A Scoping Review of GDPR Effects on Serious Games Research Ethics Reporting","On May 25 th , 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force. Recognised as a comprehensive regulation for improving privacy and data protection, a substantial impact on data processing disciplines such as Serious Games (SG) research was expected. By conducting a scoping review, this paper explores the effects of GDPR on reporting of ethics approval, informed consent, ethics guidelines and data protection in SG studies. Five scientific databases were searched for research between 2016 and 2020 addressing Serious Games, Exergames and Applied Games. A total of 2146 full-text studies split into equal collections before and after GDPR were included. Lexicometric and keyword-in-context analysis were conducted and comparatively evaluated regarding ethics reporting and trends. Results unexpectedly show that GDPR so far hardly left a mark. While a slight increase of 12% in general ethics reporting can be observed, less than 6% of the studies after GDPR coming-into-force report on data protection. Ethics procedures remained consistent with most researchers reporting the approval from their home university committee and stating the Declaration of Helsinki as followed guidelines. Overall, the verifiable impact of GDPR was found negligibly small, with only 0.5% of studies referring to the regulation in the two years after introduction. Conclusively, further research is suggested to focus on integrating ethics and data protection guided on GDPR from an early conceptual stage to the reporting of the findings.",NULL,NULL

190,"Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment Through Real-Time Physiological Feedback for a More Adapted Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy","Like many researchers, we think that the use of dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA) to offer an appropriate balance between the skills of the player and the difficulty of the gameplay is an appropriate avenue to maintain the flow of a user. We analyze this approach in a virtual reality serious game dedicated to people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Knowing that heart rate is a good indicator of the emotional state of people with PTSD, we collect this variable in real-time to propose a virtual reality dynamic adjusted system based on the emotional state of the subject. The proposed adaptation system can be approached in three modes: the offline mode which consists on therapist selections before launching the game, the manual online mode during which the therapist can adapt the virtual environment while the subject is exposed, and the computational online mode that runs a DDA algorithm to automatically adjust the game.",NULL,NULL

Firstly, anti-doping education should be based on state-of-art learning pedagogies that will enable effective engagement, learning and retention of the learned material. Secondly, currently there is a lack of such a systematic approach for evaluating the behavior change outcomes of anti-doping educational interventions. Thirdly, there is a lack of other known anti-doping educational interventions that promote a positive approach to doping prevention. Finally, anti-doping educational interventions should incorporate the learning process in the context of new learning technologies that can also facilitate behavior change outcomes.

The aim of this paper is to offer methodological guidelines to build collaborative serious games based on intelligent agents along with awareness services in order to support virtual learning processes. This methodological guide offers a breakdown of the main activities needed to build this kind of systems based on three components: the knowledge representation of the domain to which the collaborative serious game is oriented, the development of the MAS, and finally the description and integration of awareness services. The preliminary validation of methodological guidelines through a prototype development shows that the integration of these kinds of technologies fosters the knowledge acquisition in a playful way by the students while learning in a collaborative way.",NULL,NULL

197,"Floor Projection Type Serious Game System for Lower Limb Rehabilitation Using Image Processing","We described about a rehabilitation system for lower limbs using floor projection type serious game in this paper. In this system, the target is displayed on the floor, and when the user steps on the target, the target disappears and the score is added. Shoot the movement of the users foot with a TV camera and judge whether or not the target has been stepped by using image processing. The user stands in front of the display area, steps on the target as the target appears. When the target disappears, put the foot back and return to the first posture. By repeating this movement, the user can exercise the lower limbs. The exercise performed in this system is called a Step Exercise and is commonly performed as rehabilitation effective for improving the sense of balance and increasing the muscular strength of the lower limbs. We measured the number that could be erased and the number that could not be erased (the number the system did not respond) when stepping on the target by the foot, and calculated the error rate. The experiment time was 90s. As a result, the error rate was 4.7%, and the success rate was 95.3%. This was a very high recognition rate. We could judge this system has sufficiently practical accuracy as a floor projection type serious game system for lower limb rehabilitation.",NULL,NULL

First, we offer an overview of the moral competences that we aim to train through the game: an empathic concern for relevant groups; an awareness of ones susceptibility to biases and stress, moral schemas and scripts for automatized sensitivity under time pressure; a sensitivity to attitudes of moral disengagement; and skills for speaking up about ethical issues. Second, we present the educational game mechanisms and contents that we have selected and combined to achieve the desired learning outcomes: playing an intern at a clinic, learners deal with several cases, in which they have to interact with patients, patients relatives, and co-workers. Their decisions, including the way they communicate, have immediate as well as delayed consequences, and players receive constant feedback in terms of three value categories (empathy, integrity, efficiency). Third, we discuss how we employ the game within our study program. We close with a discussion of a possible critique of our design and with an outlook on the further design process.",NULL,NULL
199,"AAT Meets Virtual Reality","Smoking is still one of the main causes of premature mortality and is associated with a variety of diseases. Nevertheless, a large part of the society smokes. Many of them do not seek treatment, and the path to smoking cessation is often abandoned. For this reason, we have developed a VR application that uses the AAT procedure, which has already achieved positive results in the detection and treatment of addiction disorders, as a basic procedure. We want to support the classical therapies by increasing the motivation of the affected patients through immersion, embodiment and game design elements. For this purpose, we have initially developed and evaluated a first demonstrator. Based on the results and findings, a completely revised VR application was programmed, which also eliminates the identified errors and problems of the first demonstrator. In addition, a mobile application will be developed to support the treatment. Our results show that the transfer of the AAT procedure into virtual reality, and thus into three-dimensional space, is possible and promising. We also found that three-dimensional stimuli should be preferred, since the interaction with them was more intuitive and entertaining for the participants. The benefits of game design elements in combination with the representation of interactions in the form of a hand with gripping animations also proved to be of great value, as this increased immersion, embodiment, and therefore motivation.",NULL,NULL
200,"Adaptive Agents for Fit-for-Purpose Training","Simulators and games provide contextually rich environments, enabling learners to experience the relations between actions, events and outcomes. In order to be effective, learning situations need to be tailored to the needs of the individual learner. Virtual characters (or agents ) that, in real time , select, adapt, and exhibit the behavior that is exactly right for that learner, help to establish such fit-for-purpose training. This paper discusses principles for designing training with adaptive agents, and presents a framework for their autonomous and dynamic operation. A prerequisite for agents adaptation of behavior to be successful is that adjustments do not violate the consistency and believability of the character, and maintains the overall narrative of the scenario. For reasons of management and coordination, it is proposed not to assign control over adaptations to virtual character-agents themselves, but to a dedicated director agent . This director agent is not a virtual character in the gameplay, but operates in the background. It collects and manages information, makes decisions about adaptations and issues behavioral instructions to the virtual characters agents. The framework was used in a pilot study, employing a human facilitator that simulated a director agent, arranging the adaptive behavior of virtual characters in a game-based training of military tactical decision making. Effects of adaptive and non-adaptive agents in a training were compared. Adaptive agents had a positive influence on learning and performance, and an increased engagement and appreciation by learners. Additional research with more participants is needed to verify these preliminary findings.",NULL,NULL

203,"Using a Virtual Reality Serious Game to Assess the Performance of Older Adults with Frailty","Objectives: The comparison of cognitive performance of older adults with frailty and non-frail ones (according to Frieds criteria) was investigated. Methods/Design: The differences in performance between people with frailty and individuals without frailty according to Fried were tested using a Virtual Reality (VR) application. The Fried criteria for frailty were used to categorize users into study groups, while standardized batteries were used for a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment, including Activities of Daily Living (ADL), lifestyle, cognition, and depression screening. A group of 80 elders (78.08years old in average) played the VR game entitled Virtual Supermarket (VSM). From those, 39 were healthy controls and 30 were categorized as pre-frail and 11 as frail. The VSM application presented users with a virtual shopping experience where users had to locate and purchase items displayed in a shopping list. This application was designed to test players ability to reproduce a typical customer behavior in a simulated environment which requires spatial orientation, short-term memory, selective attention, and cognition speed. The performance, duration, and error rate were used as measurements. Results: The analysis showed that there was a statistically significant difference in game performance between the different user groups with X 2 (2)=9.929, p =0.007. Moreover, the multinomial logistic regression model generated, which based on game performance metrics, was found to be statistically significant with X 2 (4)=15.662, p =0.004. Conclusions: Results shed more light toward the possible use of VR for distant self-administered evaluation of the frail status.",NULL,NULL

The shows share uncanny historical consonances: both were massively profitable in the subsidised theatre and the West End but were seen to have failed on Broadway. Their extra-theatrical lives thus supplement their dramatisation of corporate finance in a way that is at odds with their own condemnations of market-driven capitalist society, revealing the extent to which the plays, themselves, represent artistic commodities bought and sold in a commercial market, products of corporate entities whose measure of success hinges exclusively on profit-making.",NULL,NULL

The exploitation of Virtual Reality is investigated to test innovative entertainment and therapeutic activities that can provide new stimuli and interests for patients. The game approach activates mechanisms able to train memory and energize the mind through visuospatial and sound inputs. A full-immersive application has been developed to allow the patient to perform this kind of experience at home for daily training, becoming short therapeutic cycles, thanks to the affordability, the transportability and the flexibility of the infrastructure put in place. The cognitive path foresees successive levels of interaction, alternating relaxing and inspiring settings and exercises.

In this way, these kind of experience can generate positive benefits not only for those who show fragility, but also for their families in addition to a tool to support health workers for diagnostics and training.",NULL,NULL
208,"TrueBiters, an educational game to practice the truth tables of propositional logic: Development, evaluation, and lessons learned","Since years, the logic course in the first year of our Bachelor program in Computer Science, dealing with propositional and predicate logic, suffers from poor pass rates. The students perceive the formal and abstract mechanisms of logic as difficult and awkward to deal with. Many students do not study the course material on a regular basis, which results in poor mastery of the basic concepts and principles. Consequently, students often fall behind as the course progresses. Previous attempts to remedy this procrastination behavior had little success. Since educational games are commended as an enjoyable way to foster learning, we decided in 2016 to develop an educational game for the course. This game, called TrueBiters, is a two-player competitive game inspired by an existing card game. We adapted this card game to propositional logic and digitized it as an app. The development was done in an iterative way. Each version was evaluated and using the received user feedback and evaluation results the game was improved and reevaluated. Based on the results of the evaluations we can conclude that the game is well suited for its target audience, i.e., logically-mathematically intelligent people, and is a good supplement, and even replacement for some of the traditional face-to-face exercise sessions. However, we also learned that a proper embedding into the course is needed to ensure that all students actually use the game and benefit from playing it. In this paper we present the game, explain and motivate its evolution, discuss the evaluations performed, and present lessons learned.",NULL,NULL

However, to date there is no evidence of effectiveness of multicomponent smartphone-based interventions. Utilising a user-centred design approach, we developed a theory-based, multi-dimensional system, PEGASO Fit For Future (PEGASO F4F), which exploits sophisticated game mechanics involving smartphone applications, a smartphone game and activity sensors to motivate teenagers to take an active role in adopting and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. This paper describes the study protocol to assess the feasibility, usability and effectiveness (knowledge/awareness and behavioural change in lifestyle) of the PEGASO system. Methods We are conducting a quasi-experimental controlled cluster trial in 4 sites in Spain, Italy, and UK (England, Scotland) over 6months. We plan to recruit 525, in a 2:1 basis, teenagers aged 1316years from secondary schools. The intervention group is provided with the PEGASO system whereas the comparison group continues their usual educational routine. Outcomes include feasibility, acceptance, and usability of the PEGASO system as well as between and within group changes in motivation, self-reported diet, physical activity, sedentary and sleeping behaviour, anthropometric measures and knowledge about a healthy lifestyle. Discussion PEGASO F4F will provide evidence into the cross-cultural similarities and differences in the feasibility, acceptability and usability of a multi-dimensional smartphone based behaviour change intervention for teenagers. The study will explore facilitating factors, challenges and barriers of engaging teenagers to adapt and maintain a healthy lifestyle when using smartphone technology. Positive results from this ICT based multi component intervention may have significant implications both at clinical level, improving teenagers health and at public health level since it can present an influential tool against the development of chronic disease during adulthood.

Researchers from the fields of metacognition and learning, as well as motivation and learning have thus intensively investigated issues related to the self-evaluation of competences. Insights from both lines of research have been used in the serious game project SERENA to inform the selection and design of technical tasks and tutorial feedback strategies. The main goal of the SERENA project was to develop a serious game for adolescent females that fosters their self-evaluation of competence regarding technical tasks. This paper describes how insights from metacognition, motivation and feedback research were integrated to inform the game design. Furthermore, it reports two evaluation studies conducted with 93 students in real school settings. The findings reveal that girls self-evaluation of competences assessed in terms of perceived technical competences and self-concept of technical abilities, as well as intrinsic motivation regarding technical tasks can be strengthened with the serious game Serena Supergreen. The log-file analyses indicate that seeking feedback and help within the game is associated with an increase in perceived competences.

This location-aware augmented reality mobile game continues to be played by millions of people every day. Based on an online survey identifying 438 Pokmon GO players from 34 countries the present study examines if playing Pokmon GO sends people to locations, cities and countries beyond their normal sphere of activity and makes them feel happier and more successful. Descriptive statistics, factor analysis and regression were used to analyze data. Results show that playing the networked game on a mobile device increases visitation to local tourism attractions, and motivates people to spend more time outdoors and walking. It also sends them to cities and countries they might not otherwise visit and acts as an alternative to spending time indoors playing computer games. Surveyed players feel happier and more successful after playing the game. Pokmon GO might have value as the center of a tourism product for those players. The opportunity to acquire Pokmon and encounter others involved in the game across a destination, or in a single attraction, could pull players to that place. These are the attributes of people in pursuit of serious leisure. Pokmon GO players know more about local attractions than before playing. Pokmon GO players visit more tourist attractions than before playing. Pokmon GO players spend more time in outdoor physical activity than before playing. Pokmon GO players who play more feel happier and more successful than those who play less. Pokmon GO has the potential to attract people to destinations and places as they play the game.",NULL,NULL

There is controversy about the effectiveness of commercial video games for brain training, therefore it is necessary to assess the utility of these kinds of games. One quantitative method to assess it is electroencephalography (EEG), a non-invasive technique to study brain activity. This paper explores the use of EEG and video games together to find what are the most used techniques when analyzing the signals by means of a systematic review. From the results of that review two partial contributions were obtained: a taxonomy of techniques to analyze EEG signals, and a ranking of these techniques based on their popularity. The partial contributions were the departure point for working in the main contribution of this paper: eeglib, a Python library for analyzing EEG. The library was tested technically and functionally. The technical test was oriented to assess the correct output of certain algorithms, while the functional one consisted in analyzing data from two different experiments to check the effectiveness of the library.",NULL,NULL
213,"Sociodemographic Risk Factors for Serious Psychological Distress among U.S. Veterans: Findings from the 2016 National Health Interview Survey","Serious Psychological Distress (SPD) is a measure of mental health associated with poor functioning. This study identified sociodemographic risk factors for SPD, among veterans using Veterans Health Administration (VHA), TRICARE or the Civilian Health and Medical Programs for Uniformed Services (CHAMP) (all referred herein as VA coverage) and compared risk factors for SPD to non-veterans. VA coverage offers preventative care and treatment for illnesses and injuries to veterans with the aim of improving their quality of life. Veterans with and with no SPD, using VA coverage aged 18 to 64years were sampled from the 2016 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) ( n =525 total, n =48 veterans with serious psychological distress) were compared to each other and to non-veterans sampled from the NHIS ( n =24,121 total and n =1055 with serious psychological distress), by sex, age group, race/ethnicity, education level, living arrangements, education level, number of chronic health conditions, and region of residence. The greatest proportion of veterans with SPD were female, middle aged (4564years), white, had less than a high school education, and lived alone or with other adults (compared to those living with a spouse/partner). The greatest proportion of veterans with SPD lived in the Southern and Western U.S. regions, and the smallest proportion lived in the Northeastern U.S. region. Hispanic and white veterans were at increased risk for SPD relative to black veterans, and relative to their same race/ethnic counterparts in the non-veteran civilian population. Additional analyses suggest that veterans with SPD experience greater barriers to care compared to veterans without SPD. Further research is warranted to examine access to mental and physical health care providers in U.S. regions with the greatest proportions of veterans with SPD. Particular attention is needed for female veterans due to their high rates of SPD relative to male veterans.",NULL,NULL

Therefore, this paper focuses on the design and development of a novel framework for the rapid design of body-motion-based customizable game-like applications. This framework consists of two components: (i) an interface that allows the user to design the game and capture the motion data, and (ii) a customizable game for learning and training using off-the-shelf motion-capture sensors like the Microsoft Kinect. The game is automatically configured based on the output of the game design interface. In order to evaluate the proposed system, three pilot-use cases have been selected: (i) the Latin dance Salsa, (ii) the Greek traditional dance Tsamiko, and (iii) the Walloon (Belgian) traditional dance. Moreover, small-scaled experiments concerning the three different use cases were conducted, where both beginners and experts evaluated the game-like application for dance learning. Furthermore, a group of dance experts were asked to design and generate their own game and evaluate their experience. Results showed that the use of such a game-like application could be efficient, as positive feedback was obtained. In summary, participants found that the generated game-like application meets its objectives; it is generally efficient and satisfactory and offers a novel tool for ICH transmission and education. Last but not the least, the dance experts expressed their interest in developing more such games in the future, since they characterized the game design module as easy and intuitive to use.",NULL,NULL
215,"How Serious Games for Health Enhance Empowerment-Related Patient Education: The Impact of Gender","Based on behavioral science assumptions, the main purpose of this study is to validate a theoretical model of the relationship between serious game play, patient empowerment and health-related behaviors. We first hypothesized that serious games for health enhanced patients empowerment-related education; second, we expected that gender may influence such an educational model. To test our hypotheses, 124 Italian young diabetics (Mean age=14.12years old, SD=2.14; 59.67% female) were involved in the research study named Tako Dojo. After participating to a training session about the use of the serious game for diabetes, they filled in a questionnaire that included several scales of game experience, patient empowerment and adherence-related behaviors. Multiple regression analysis partially confirmed our hypotheses. First, it pointed out that serious game for health directly supported the patients empowerment and their therapeutic adherence indirectly. Then, it showed that patients gender influenced the game-based patient empowerment. To conclude, some relevant theoretical issues concerning the game-based patient education and practical implications about the game design in the healthcare contexts were highlighted.",NULL,NULL

217,"Developing kindergarten students game design skills by teaching game design through organized game design interventions","Developing students game design skills and the process of teaching game design acquire increasing research interest. The aim of this study was to (a) examine the impact of game design teaching interventions to kindergarten students and (b) examine the design of such interventions for teaching game design to students of this age. In that regard, this paper presents a teaching experiment, conducted with students in the early childhood. The experiment followed a quasi-experimental design, with a pre-test and a post-test and a focus and control groups. For a period of three months, only the focus group was presented with participatory game design activities while the control group followed the standard curriculum. During those interventions, students of the focus group worked on designing educational games about teaching pre-algebraic patterning to their peers. A mixed methods analysis was applied to analyze the results, which suggest that the facilitation of participatory game design activities has a positive impact on the development of game design skills. Additionally, this paper elaborates on issues that emerged through the study related to collaborative and individual work of students, difficulties in focusing on designing educational games and diversity of game proposals.",NULL,NULL
218,"The co-design, implementation and evaluation of a serious board game PlayDecide patient safety to educate junior doctors about patient safety and the importance of reporting safety concerns","Background We believe junior doctors are in a unique position in relation to reporting of incidents and safety culture. They are still in training and are also fresh eyes on the system providing valuable insights into what they perceive as safe and unsafe behaviour. The aim of this study was to co-design and implement an embedded learning intervention  a serious board game  to educate junior doctors about patient safety and the importance of reporting safety concerns, while at the same time shaping a culture of responsiveness from senior medical staff. Methods A serious game based on the PlayDecide framework was co-designed and implemented in two large urban acute teaching hospitals. To evaluate the educational value of the game voting on the position statements was recorded at the end of each game by a facilitator who also took notes after the game of key themes that emerged from the discussion. A sample of players were invited on a voluntary basis to take part in semi-structured interviews after playing the game using Flanagans Critical Incident Technique. A paper-based questionnaire on Safety Concerns was developed and administered to assess pre-and post-playing the game reporting behaviour. Dissemination workshops were held with senior clinicians to promote more inclusive leadership behaviours and responsiveness to junior doctors raising of safety concerns from senior clinicians. Results The game proved to be a valuable patient safety educational tool and proved effective in encouraging deep discussion on patient safety. There was a significant change in the reporting behaviour of junior doctors in one of the hospitals following the intervention. Conclusion In healthcare, limited exposure to patient safety training and narrow understanding of safety compromise patients lives. The existing healthcare system needs to value the role that junior doctors and others could play in shaping a positive safety culture where reporting of all safety concerns is encouraged. Greater efforts need to be made at hospital level to develop a more pro-active safe and just culture that supports and encourages junior doctors and ultimately all doctors to understand and speak up about safety concerns.",NULL,NULL
219,"Supporting struggling readers with digital game-based learning","This study investigates the effectiveness of a digital gameGraphoLearn (GL)in supporting second-grade students who have persistent difficulties with acquiring accurate and fluent reading skills. The participants ( N =37) were randomly assigned either to a 6-week intervention including sessions with GL, in addition to school-provided support, or a control group receiving only school-provided support. The intervention took place at the students homes and schools under the supervision of their parents and teachers. The results showed that the children who received the GL intervention developed significantly faster in word reading than the control group. Moreover, their reading development was significantly faster during the GL intervention compared with that of the follow-up period, which included only typical school-provided support. No transfer effects on reading fluency, reading comprehension, or spelling were found. Furthermore, the children who, according to the observations of their parents and teachers, showed higher cognitive engagement during the intervention had higher gains in word reading and sentence reading fluency than the children who appeared less cognitively engaged. Higher emotional engagement was related to increased playing time but not to larger gains in reading. The study indicates that a short digital game-based intervention training of lettersound correspondences and word-level reading can give a boost to the reading development of struggling readers. Inspecting the engagement and in-game performance during gameplay provides important information that can be used for further development of the game to respond to the needs of the learners with severe difficulties.",NULL,NULL

222,"Falls Sensei: a serious 3D exploration game to enable the detection of extrinsic home fall hazards for older adults","Background Falls are the main cause of death and injury for older adults in the UK. Many of these falls occur within the home as a result of extrinsic falls risk factors such as poor lighting, loose/uneven flooring, and clutter. Falls education plays an important role in self-management education about extrinsic hazards and is typically delivered via information leaflets, falls apps, and educational booklets. Serious games have the potential of delivering an engaging and informative alternative to traditional methods but almost exclusively, these are currently delivered as exergaming applications that focus solely on intrinsic falls risk factors. This study presents Falls Sensei a first-person 3D exploration game that aims to educate older adults about extrinsic falls risk factors within the home environment. After presenting Falls Sensei, game usability and older adults perceptions and attitudes towards using the game in practice are explored. Methods This study involved 15 community dwelling older adults. After playing the Falls Sensei game, participants completed a Systems Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire and post task interview, and follow-up interviews three weeks later. Inductive and deductive thematic template analysis, informed by the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model, was used to analyse the think-aloud, post-task and follow-up interview transcripts. Descriptive statistical analysis and one-sampled t-tests were used to analyse log-file data and SUS responses. Results Three high-level themes emerged from the analysis of transcriptions: Performance Expectancy; Effort Expectancy; Social Influence. The SUS score was 77.5/100 which indicates Good levels of usability. Interestingly, reported usability of the game increased with participant age. Participants were positive about the usability of the game ( p <= 0.05 for 9/10 items). The most memorable fall hazards were those most commonly encountered in the game or those most challenging to participants. Conclusions The results support the use of serious games as an engaging tool for educating older adults about extrinsic falls risk factors. Awareness of home hazard detection was raised by the game, and some older adults became more aware for the need to adapt their own homes after gameplay. Further research would be needed to draw comparisons with established interventions.",NULL,NULL

In this way, the curative treatment would not burden the hospital with excessive costs and the patient with psychological disorientation. Recent studies have shown the efficacy of video games on improving cognitive processes impaired by ageings physiological effect, neurodegenerative or other diseases, with potential beneficial effects. The PERvasive game for perSOnalized treatment of cognitive and functional deficits associated with chronic and Neurodegenerative diseases (PERSON) project proposed new tools for cognitive rehabilitation, aiming to improve the quality of life for patients with cognitive impairments, especially at early stages, by the use of sophisticated, non-invasive technology. This article is an overview of game solutions for training cognitive abilities and it presents the tools developed within the PERSON project. These tools are serious games based on virtual reality, connected to a brain-computer interface based on electroencephalography (EEG) and to haptic devices. The project was born thanks to a strategic synergy between research and public health, to implement a technology for personalized medicine that relies on the cloud infrastructure of the REte di CAlcolo per SuperB ed altre applicazioni (ReCaS)-Bari data centre. PERSON developed a completely open source and innovative framework to interface the game device with the computational resources in the cloud.

225,"Learning prosocial skills through multiadaptive games: a case study","Digital games introduce an innovative means for teaching prosocial skills to students; however, the lack of proper personalization features in the games may result in the degradation of the learning process. This paper aims to study whether the performance of students in a prosocial game could be improved by an intelligent AI adaptation mechanism. To this end, a novel hybrid adaptation manager capable of assisting students playing prosocial games is presented. Our approach consists of a combination of two adaptation mechanisms that process personalization information both offline and in real-time. Both implementations are based on artificial intelligence techniques and adjust game content in order to increase the chances of players attaining the games specific learning objectives concerning prosocial skills. In particular, the online mechanism maintains a player engagement profile for game elements that are intended to represent the pedagogical practices of corrective feedback and positive reinforcement. On the other hand, offline adaptation matches players to game scenarios according to the players ability and the game scenarios ranking. The efficiency of the proposed adaptation manager as a tool for enhancing students performance in a prosocial game is demonstrated through a small-scale experiment, under real-time conditions in a school environment, using the prosocial game Path of Trust.",NULL,NULL

This work proposes the development of a serious game-based system motivated by the results of a study concerning children with Down Syndrome (DS) and their laterality (left-right recognition) difficulty. This preliminary study was carried out using a system designed with the purpose to evaluate the childrens functional performance through data acquired using an RGB-D camera Kinect v2. This system uses a performance assessment protocol to analyze the laterality ability in children, providing a mirror-type visual feedback to the user. Thirteen participants (twelve with DS and one without DS) with ages between nine and ten years old were evaluated. In this evaluation, the childrens success percentage in distinguishing left from right was only 30.0%, confirming their laterality issue. Based on this preliminary validation, the serious game-based system was implemented as a proposal of an intelligent environment for the development of the right and left recognition. In general, children with DS are not able to pay attention for as much time as typical children.

Learning at the cognitive behavioral level is underpinned by neurophysiological changes in brain structure and connectivity across different parts of the brain as the learner interacts with others and the environment. Studies of epigenetic processes show that learning is dynamic, requiring learner engagement and contingent feedback. Agency, contingency and appropriate feedback are also keys to learning effectiveness at higher cognitive levels. The field of instructional design has traditionally focused on supporting the instructor, built on a model of learning as receiving instructions . Based on learning outcomes that are important for learners in the twenty-first century (communication, collaboration, creativity, critical thinking, and global competence), this model of learning support is outdated and irrelevant. This chapter begins with a review of key research directions in the deployment of technology-enhanced learning for infants and children based on neuroscience research, with a focus on social robots and serious games. It then reviews the challenges in the assessment and provision of learning support for collaborative problem-solving. The chapter ends by identifying some research directions for interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers in learning/instructional design and the science of learning that will help to advance theory and educational practice in collaborative problem-solving.",NULL,NULL
246,"Games and Learning: Potential and Limitations from the Players Point of View","In recent times, numerous researchers and educators have been exploring playful learning with digital games in both formal and informal contexts. This study explores the point of view of players on the relationship between digital games and learning, based on a set of semi-structured interviews and two workshops involving relevant stakeholder groups (players, teachers, trainee teachers, and parents). Analysis of the gathered qualitative and quantitative data reveals that both players and educators agree that games have educational potential, but the assumption of blanket learner enthusiasm for game based learning is not always accurate. In particular, players have some resistance towards serious games, which are seen as less appealing than real videogames. In addition, some players and some teachers feel that the use of games in formal learning contexts contradicts the fundamental freedom intrinsic to the act of playing. Players are aware of the risks video-gaming presents, but they do not appear to be fully aware of its learning potential, as most mention lower order skills (memory, attention, reaction time) rather than academic knowledge and soft skills. Some mention game potential for the development of their social, cultural and gender identity, with consequential positive effects on their ethical beliefs. Players also point out the importance of videogame education for teachers, parents and for themselves. Lastly, they feel the need for innovation in games that, through innovative game mechanics and narratives, enhances the cultural and artistic component of games.",NULL,NULL
247,"A Serious Game Proposal to Reinforce Reading Comprehension in Scholars","Reading comprehension is a cognitive activity, which development promotes complex and fundamental processes helpful to access learning; it is connected to the world understanding in a participatory way. Consequently, it is essential to acquire this ability at an early age. Particularly for children, the videogames motivational aspect makes them an attractive resource in reading comprehension. In this paper is presented the development process of a serious game as a support for the reading comprehension process. The videogame is oriented to strategies related to syntax through fill-in-the-blank exercises. The game tutorial is illustrative for the children to understand the game mechanics, the avatar movements and the interaction with the game elements; an exploratory study was conducted to observe its effectiveness.",NULL,NULL

It makes it possible to customize the game according to each learner individuality . To deal with adaptativity, this chapter proposes a Model-Driven Engineering approach that supports dynamic scenarization instead of implementing fixed configurations of learning scenarios. The base principle is to consider the generation of scenarios as a model transformation of a learner profile and a game description models toward adapted scenarios. This proposal has been applied to the context of the Escape-it! research project that aims to propose an escape-room game for helping children with Autistic Syndrome Disorder (ASD) to learn visual performance skills .",NULL,NULL

Hence, this paper presents the initial work focusing on design phase by presenting a comparative analysis of educational game design models using GBL attributes, validity and framework attributes as analytical lens. The main objective is to analyze the fundamental GBL attributes in existing design models to identify the common attributes which demonstrate their importance for design phase and highlight any need for further research in terms of attribute validation and framework improvement. This study also highlights the strengths and weakness of existing design frameworks. The results of analysis underline learning/pedagogical aspects and game factors as the most essential attributes for design phase of educational games. Comparative analysis also guides researchers/practitioners to better understand GBL through various properties of different existing design models and highlights the open problems such as lack of tool support, empirical validation, independent evaluations, adaptability and absence of concrete guidance for application to make more informed judgments.",NULL,NULL
252,"Facial Virtual Tracking: A System to Mirror Emotions","The capacity for social interaction, communication and recognition of emotions is a characteristic that the human being possesses and that allows him/her to be socially included. However, some have difficulties in expressing and interpreting emotional states, which can contribute to their marginalisation in society. A particular case is children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. These children have difficulties in social interaction and manifest repetitive patterns. In this work, a serious game is being developed in which an avatar (ZECA avatar) is able to interact with the child, through challenges and training of certain facial movements that will be validated by the system, facilitating imitation and recognition of emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, surprise and fear). The tests performed in the laboratory environment allowed to conclude the adequacy of the game for promoting emotional states in a friendly way.",NULL,NULL

A detailed worked example applies the workflow to the development of a serious tabletop game with the educational goal of increasing knowledge and confidence of performing postgraduate literature reviews. Systematic application of the workflow to a real example supports the value of this approach and provides a useful template for educators to follow for increasing the quality and feasibility of self-designed serious games.",NULL,NULL
254,"A Systematic Mapping Study on Game Elements and Serious Games for Learning Programming","This work aims to verify how serious games and their composing elements are used and evaluated to support learning programming. Serious games have been used as a tool to support learning in several areas and subjects. To achieve its educational goals, a serious game must consist of a set of game elements that are related to the learning outcomes. In Computer Science, educators are also using serious games and their elements to enhance learning of programming-related disciplines, which are often considered challenging by first-year students. To achieve our goal we defined three research questions: (1) What are the serious games for learning programming? (2) What are the game elements in the serious games for learning programming? and (3) What is the empirical strategies and methods used to evaluate existing game elements? A systematic mapping study on the use and evaluation of game elements for learning programming was conducted. Our systematic literature search found 27 elements of games distributed in 43 serious games. The elements of games are present in 39 primary studies that date from 2007 to 2016. The elements of games more reported in the literature were: Fantasy, Goal, Level, Point System, and Quest. Our results also indicate that game elements are only evaluated indirectly by means of their serious games. Furthermore, we identify some shortcomings in primary studies found, such as the lack of systematic evaluation, for instance, by means of controlled experiments and the low number of quantitative studies.",NULL,NULL

Innovation platforms offer modes of collaboration for schools, universities, citizens, and companies. The main actors of this project are three universities and two science centres in Finland. Several modes for collaboration have been tried in order to discover permanent structures that would benefit various stakeholders. Interests of different stakeholders have been analysed in order to find conditions for successful co-creation. Problems that prevent efficient collaboration have been identified, which are predominantly financial issues. Moreover, some more game-specific issues have been discovered: the understanding of use of games in education and pedagogical goals and methods are not necessarily shared between game developers and educators. Game developers seek to create games that are entertaining, whereas educators want tools that support curriculum goals and enhance learning. However, the idea of collaborative design practices in learning has been welcomed by all stakeholders. In particular, the co-creation in science centres has started successfully, bringing small start-up companies and school students together around educational application development where science centres act as facilitators. Recommendations for best practices in universities are drafted in order to find efficient ways of implementation.",NULL,NULL
260,"How a Tangible User Interface Contributes to Desired Learning Outcomes of the Virtual River Serious Game","Serious games are increasingly used to facilitate stakeholder discussion and collaboration. Much attention is given in the game design literature on how to choose and design a serious games scope, content, mechanics, and link to reality in order to achieve the games intended learning outcomes. In this paper, we focus on how a serious games interface and the interaction it elicits contributes to achieving learning outcomes. We do so in the context of the Virtual River, a serious game focused on river management. Following the design and evaluation of a paper prototype of the Virtual River, a design challenge arose as the highly simplified models of reality used was perceived as a black box by non-expert participants, while expert participants perceived it as oversimplified and unrealistic. As hydrodynamic models used in river management practice are in itself perceived by non-experts as a black box, we decided to look for ways to simplify the interaction with such models in the game. Here, we present a tangible user interface for the Virtual River. The interface enables participants to get a better grip on the hydrodynamics of a river system. The system is set up as a discussion platform where the game board and its tangible game pieces help participants express their thoughts and ideas. We argue that using tangible interaction in Virtual River contributes to social learning outcomes by providing hypotheses based on literature and present how we intend to test these hypotheses.",NULL,NULL

Autism tend to have difficulty with interpersonal relationships because they find it difficult to understand conversational implicatures. As a solution to this problem, we propose a serious game to enable typically developing to learn how to speak to autism in a way they can understand, including how best to convey conversational implicatures. This serious game simulates the experience of autism of being unable to understand conversational implicatures, using conversations based on real life examples, in order to teach players why autism cannot understand what they mean and how they can paraphrase their message. To verify the efficacy of this serious game, an experiment was conducted with 56 students. Experimental results suggested that the system is effective for learning how to speak especially among typically developing who were rarely involved with autism.",NULL,NULL

Background: Although the field of serious games has developed over the last three decades, the potential of games to be used as civic engagement and educational tools still lay unrealized. People in rural communities in India experience a range of barriers for constructive engagement. Serious games have been used to address the issue of civic engagement effectively. In this paper, we present a case study of Aadarsh Gaon, build your ideal village , a tabletop game where participants work together to discuss strategies to solve social issues in their community, in order to win the game. The paper discusses the concepts in the game, evolution of the game during playtesting and aspects of collaborative gameplay. Results: Three phases of playtesting with diverse participants suggest that the game could trigger focused discussions on strategy creation to solve social problems, but do not indicate significant progress in attitude towards service leadership, and planning and resource allocation. We conclude that serious games with purposeful game design elements could lead to constructive civic engagement.",NULL,NULL
267,"Measuring Preferences in Game Mechanics: Towards Personalized Chocolate-Covered Broccoli","When developing educational games we face the problem of finding the right design for making the learning activities as intrinsic to the game mechanics as possible. Nevertheless, in many cases it is not possible to fully integrate the learning content into the game play, resulting in the well known chocolate-covered broccoli game design. The long term goal of the work presented here is to determine whether a personalized selection of game mechanics for the playful part, the game mechanics around the learning part of the game, can improve the satisfaction of the player and therefore make the whole learning experience more enjoyable. The first step towards that goal is to obtain a model for the preferences of game mechanics for a particular type of game, and later use that model to guide the selection of game mechanics. In this paper, we present Enigma MNCN a treasure hunt for mobile devices designed for the National Museum of Natural Sciences of Spain and some experimental results intended to identify preferences for game mechanics in that type of game across demographic variables. The main finding of these experiments is that preferences in game mechanics get shadowed when combined with a mostly disliked learning mechanic.",NULL,NULL
268,"Interactive Learning of Factual Contents Using a Game-Like Quiz","Computer games are widely recognised for the attention they get from their players. Beyond mere games are serious games created to teach specific subjects or concepts. Arguably, two of the most addictive mechanisms in serious games are: the scoring design, and the game interface. These mechanisms have been proven to increase the interest of players in such games, balancing their learning experience with the fun. Quiz systems, by contrast, are mere educational tools with little or no interesting devices. In this paper we propose a new classification for some mid-point between serious games and quiz systems, suggesting an equilibrium by adding some fun and keeping the educational content of quiz systems. We also describe the development of a new quiz system designed with Abeced . It is designed with game-like interactive feedback mechanisms for testing students on factual contents across different subjects. Abeced , mimicking most serious games, is designed with an interesting interface and a voice feedback to enhance students learning experience.

In the current study, third-graders played the Number Trace Fractions prototype in which they estimated fraction locations and compared fraction magnitudes on a number line. The intervention consisted of five 30min playing sessions. Conceptual fraction knowledge was assessed with a paper based pre- and posttest. Additionally, after the intervention students fraction comparison strategies were explored with game-based comparison tasks including self-explanation prompts. The results support previous findings indicating that game-based interventions emphasizing fraction magnitudes improve students performance in conceptual fraction tasks. Nevertheless, the results revealed that in spite of clear improvement many students tended to use false fraction magnitude comparison strategies after the intervention. It seems that the game mechanics and the feedback that the game provided did not support conceptual change processes of students with low prior knowledge well enough and common fraction misconceptions still existed. Based on these findings we further developed the game and extended it with physical manipulatives. The aim of this extension is to help students to overcome misconceptions about fraction magnitude by physically interacting with manipulatives.",NULL,NULL

In recent years, there is discussion on how valid evidence of SGs efficiency can be increased, in order to further promote their use. Thus, numerous SG design and evaluation frameworks have been introduced, many of which have proved useful for SGs developing teams. Despite this, however, for novice designers, this vast array can be daunting. The aim of the present paper is to combine well-known frameworks and extract the conceptual factors that need to be considered when designing an SG. Having in mind that the proposed aspects are not in their essence independent, a classification of these aspects is presented, along with suggestions regarding their use and the dependencies among them. Although the various frameworks might have many common factors, there are some that highlight specific aspects of a particular factor. For instance, those frameworks that apart from the descriptive factors provide aspects regarding application, measurement, and assessment.",NULL,NULL

279,"A Digital Wooden Tabletop Maze for Estimation of Cognitive Capabilities in Children","Standardized tests play an important role in assessing a childs cognitive capabilities. The results of such tests are used e.g. in schools and kindergartens to analyze and support the development of the tested child. Unfortunately, with classical standardized tests often only limited information on a childs behavior can be documented even by a professional observer. Obtaining detailed information would require automated data recording procedures. Also, standardized tests typically rely on well-controlled and thus rather artificial environments. As a result, young children age (e.g. with an age below 7) might not be able to fully understand the test instructions, feel uncomfortable being tested outside their natural environment, and thus test results become less relevant. Computer-based stealth-assessments that e.g. use a gaming environment to be fun and to hide the assessment from children might present a valid alternative. However, for children of lower age computer-based tests are not easily applicable due to technological boundaries. In this paper we thus explore an alternative approach: physical game devices with a look and feel similar to toys typically provided to children of their age group but that embed the electronics required for computer-based stealth testing. As a result, the game device  in our case a wooden tabletop maze  combines advantages of standardized computer-free and computer-based assessments. The device allows for stealth assessments in less structured environments without creating technological boundaries for the children.",NULL,NULL

Additionally, the video game includes accessibility features that make it inclusive for people with hearing disabilities. The final goal of this work is to contribute to the improvement of English learning for people with disabilities.",NULL,NULL
282,"A Serious Game Design and Evaluation Approach to Enhance Cultural Heritage Understanding","One of the most promising means regarding the potential of supporting both, entertainment and learning, in cultural heritage sector are the Serious Games (SGs). During last decades, Cultural Heritage Serious Games (CHSGs) are being developed with the use of different technologies, in order to facilitate learning of cultural heritage via an entertaining manner. Although, there are evidences about CHSGs effects, there is the need of extracting more reliable results about their effectiveness, meaning the extent to which the initial intentions achieved their purpose. Regarding CHSGs, this purpose is twofold, which means the measurements are as much about entertainment as learning. Moreover, there is the need of increasing evidences on CHSGs effectiveness regarding higher-cognitive processes in learning. The aim of the present paper is to describe a CHSG design and evaluation approach, which is oriented to the enhancement CHSGs effectiveness in terms of entertaining and learning, as well as the extraction of more reliable results. Regarding learning aspects, the proposed approach focuses on extracting results about cultural heritage understanding. The suggested approach will be applied in a CHSG for the understanding of the Roman Forum of Thessaloniki, Greece.",NULL,NULL
283,"Learning Geothermal Energy Basics withthe Serious Game HotPipe","Burning fossil fuels is a big part of our heat production. Since this process is both non-renewable and polluting, finding other options is important. A clean and underutilized alternative is geothermal energy. However, it is often not considered due to sheer ignorance or misconceptions. HotPipe is a serious game designed to alleviate these problems, particularly among youth populations. Players control a drill to create geothermal wells solving a variety of puzzles, which introduce relevant cases for geothermal heating and show what geothermal wells are made of.

To tackle the symptoms of digital eye strain and improve eyesight, the use of eye exercises are suggested. However, few people do eye exercising as it is considered boring. In this paper we apply a serious game approach to eye exercising. We developed a PacMan style game to promote horizontal and vertical eye movements. Eye and game performance characteristics are collected during the game and used to evaluate the onset of eye fatigue during the game. The damped oscillation model is applied to observe the learning and fatigue effects. Analysis of data collected during game sessions from 14 subjects is presented.",NULL,NULL

286,"Analytical Design of Clinical Cases for Educational Games","Preparing medical students to provide emergency care is one of the biggest challenges in health education, as novices must articulate a wide spectrum, ever-growing knowledge of a generalist physician in the shortest possible time. Previous experience has shown that a problem-based e-Learning environment, presenting clinical cases to be solved by students, has several benefits in the learning process. This paper describes the design and development of an approach to produce health learning games. The approach focuses on combining student engagement with realistic narratives. The central component is a narrative scripting language that enables rapid prototyping and integration with a data analysis backed authoring process. Our method has been materialized in an educational game authoring environment that allows the creation of complex cases and automatic generation of simpler ones. The analytical design provides a scalable method to create medical learning experiences based on well-defined medical education theories and health data.",NULL,NULL

288,"Oppidum - A Serious-AR-Game About Celtic Life and History","Augmented Reality (AR) and (Serious) Games have been used to support cultural heritage experiences for a widespread audience. Combining both methods, we present a multiplayer Serious-AR-Game for Celtic Life and History. As a game the player experiences fun and competition which leads to intrinsic motivation. In contrast to existing games with a Celtic theme, our approach has been focused on historical accuracy to ensure a learning-centered foundation. The goal is to build a Celtic village with a functioning economic cycle. Especially by interacting in AR, the game becomes more perceptible, intriguing and vivid. Based on tangibles (markers tracked by a camera), playful, interactable replications of historically accurate Celtic buildings can be explored. The player can see their interior and also get information about the Celts by interacting with various objects or tools of their daily life. The collected knowledge is necessary to succeed in the quiz-war against an opponent. This project was evaluated (N=20) based on a questionnaire (GEQ) [ 10 ] to measure the game experience as well as the transferred knowledge and to get directed feedback for further development.",NULL,NULL

290,"How to Set the Game Characteristics, Design the Instructional Content and the Didactical Setting for a Serious Game for Health Prevention in the Workplace","The game simkult is a serious game for health prevention in the workplace. The design process focused on three key aspects of serious games derived from the Input-Process-Outcome model of learning with games by Garris and Driskell. In order to introduce knowledge, skills and attitudes with regard to safety and health at the workplace we systematically developed (a) the instructional content, (b) the game characteristics and (c) the context of use, which defines how the game is used and how the debriefing can be realized. As a result, simkult is a multi-player simulation game for five to 20 persons which addresses work teams in small and middle sized companies. By putting each player in the position of a restaurant manager the complex interplay of important areas towards safety and health at work (e.g. work climate, leadership) are displayed. Two core aspects within the game are the non-player characters and critical incidents which represent quests for the players in the simulation. These were developed with regard to the target groups needs in order to create an engaging and effective serious game.",NULL,NULL
291,"Change Your Mind","Among the most challenging Learning Objectives are those that require the learner to unlearn behavior - especially behavior deeply rooted in ancient evolutionary selection [ 1 ]. One such challenge is the mitigation of cognitive bias. After observing that traditional linear training does not reliably deliver lasting improvement to such deeply held cognitive behavior [ 2 ], a group of researchers began to experiment with game-based learning. Much of the success of the game experiments can be attributed to the efficacy of Adaptive Instruction Systems (AIS). The principles of AIS are usually applied consciously to the design of game-based learning. Even when they are not explicitly invoked, the nature of good game design is inherently one of adaptive instruction. This is most easily demonstrated with a case study of one of the games - Enemy of Reason . Enemy of Reason has been shown to be a particularly efficacious tool for mitigating Cognitive Bias. A large scale and complex game, it employs a variety of mechanics rooted in game design, adaptive instructional design and in the literature of intelligence analysis. Enemy of Reason is acutely relevant to the current moment. It treats cognitive bias not only as a natural phenomenon but as the result of an attack by an enemy determined to wage psychological warfare.",NULL,NULL
292,"A Serious Game for Hemophobia Treatment Phobos: First Insights","This paper addresses the development process of a serious game - PHOBOS - for hemophobia treatment. Hemophobia, also known as blood phobia, is the fear of blood, wounds, injuries, amongst others. The game addresses the issue through applied-tension exercise combined with exposure therapy on a virtual reality environment. One of the main challenges was to design a game that reconciliate in a balanced way an immersive narrative and plot with the treatment of a phobia that causes great tensions and find the best mechanics to allow a gradual exposure to blood. Artistically we wanted to create the more realistic environment possible, in tune with the sound design. This process was done with the help of a team of psychologists that in conjunction with the team of game developers created a plot that helps the player to adjust his discomfort and challenge himself in his path to deal with this phobia. We present an early stage development process of a virtual reality phobia game, from the brainstorming concept of the game to the development to the first prototype with its requirements and hardware used.",NULL,NULL

296,"Understanding Attitudes Towards Emergency Training Modes: ConventionalDrills and Serious Games","Emergency evacuation plans are central to keep people alive and safe in life-threatening situations. However, just making plans is not enough to expect positive outcomes such as no fatalities or injuries. Even a carefully devised evacuation plan becomes worthless if it is not adopted fully. Emergency training and repetitive drills are being carried out to educate people but in most situations, this training is dull. Consequently, the trend is towards other means of delivering emergency education such as games and entertainment. To understand peoples attitudes towards real drills as well as serious game based training, we developed a game for university students. The game models the university structure and shows fire erupted at certain parts of the university. The player has to evacuate using their knowledge of emergency exits and take other actions like dial an emergency number etc. After gameplay, the participants were interviewed about their preferred means of emergency education. The responses obtained demonstrate how participants feel about the seriousness of emergencies and which means of training (games based or drills) they deem productive for themselves.",NULL,NULL

299,"TurtleTable: Learn the Basics of Computer Algorithms with Tangible Interactions","Computer programming has become a basic skill and is now part of the curriculum taught in middle school. In France, this educational reform was very sudden and many teachers are not yet trained adequately to teach this subject, leaving them in search of guidelines and tools to help them. It is in this context that we propose TurtleTable, an educational game, who has two main originalities. First of all, this game is not based on writing a computer program, like most of the other tools, but rather on executing a given program, step by step. These two approaches are complementary and essential to apprehend the logic behind computer programming. Secondly, TurtleTable is played in groups of three, by manipulating Tangible objects on an Interactive Tabletop (TIT). The players have to collaboratively move the objects on a grid, by following the instructions of the program on the screen. The game immediately indicates which instructions are executed correctly, allowing the learners to correct their mistakes. TurtleTable was tested by 59 middle school students. We developed four different interactions for TurtleTable (TIT, tabletop, tablet and computer) to compare their effects on motivation, collaboration and learning. The preliminary analysis show that the students really appreciated the game, especially the TIT version, that encouraged collaboration and gave them the impression they learned more.",NULL,NULL

303,"Building a Learner Model for a Smartphone-Based Clinical Training Intervention in a Low-Income Context: A Pilot Study","Research is lacking on developing adaptive learning applications for training health workers in low-resource settings making student modelling approaches supporting individualised learning to remain largely unexplored. This study targeted a clinical training intervention using smartphones in a low-resource context to explore if clinicians performance patterns can be differentiated into distinctive groups based on an inferred proficiency level using cluster analysis. We also explored the applicability of Knowledge-Component (KC) cognitive learning models-Additive and Performance Factor Models (AFMs, PFMs) - in describing these patterns and their accuracy in predicting performance. The intervention provides simulation training on contextualised management of new-born resuscitation through a series of learning interactions that elicit responses through multiple-choice answers and interactive tasks. AFMs and PFMs were used to explore the impact of previous exposure to KCs within the learning intervention on learner performance. We demonstrate that effectiveness of low-dose-high-frequency training might be linked to successful attempts in previous learning sessions. Additionally, there exists intermediate and expert cadres of health workers who would benefit more from cascading-challenge scenarios. From these results, we propose a preliminary cognitive learning model as a basis for adaptive instructional support on smartphones for clinical training in low-resource settings.",NULL,NULL

More recently, computer video games have become widely used, particularly in secondary education, to impart important knowledge in an attractive way. Academics have proposed a number of approaches, using games-based learning, to impart theoretical and applied knowledge, especially in different disciplines. Our research is concerned with the design of an innovative educational game platform focused on the development of business and management skills. To reach this purpose, the idea is to study how well designed is the user-interface and how students interact with the applications, in order to be more effective.

In most learning scenarios, students learn individually and interact only during classes; therefore, it is difficult to enhance their communication and collaboration skills. The prototype game described in this paper aims to fill this gap and improve the students learning skills in a smart learning environment suitable for a problem-solving game. In addition, the game is also an useful tool for teachers because of the integrated chat analysis that enables the identification of the most predominant points of view and the overall level of collaboration between participants. The game is developed as a bot on the Slack chat platform and reacts to user commands. At the end of a game round, the bot is to save the conversation transcript and send it to the ReaderBench framework for further chat analysis.",NULL,NULL
306,"Consumptive and Non-Consumptive Leisure and Its Fit with Deviance","Smith and Raymen ( Theoretical Criminology , 2016) have proposed a theory of criminology revolving primarily around the concepts of harm, commodification, and leisure. This chapter inter-relates the second two ideas in a range of leisure activities found in the serious leisure perspective and shows their consumptive and non-consumptive properties for mainstream and deviant interests. A central message in all this is that commodification and consumption explain only part of the totality of leisure activities. But what about the harm caused by leisure of all types? Leisure is, by its very nature, seen by participants as basically positive activity. That harm is done within this happy scenario seems to be infrequently recognized or, if recognized, written off as unimportant. Thus the concept of harm brings a new point of reference to the study of leisure. The following pages show how widespread harm is in the domain of free time.",NULL,NULL

310,"Critical Theory and the Digital Culture-Industry","The emergence of millions of amateurs and unpaid works on the web during the blooming of social media and the rise of sharing discourse over the past decade has resulted in a large corpus of criticism on both academic and popular levels. Yet this corpus is primarily binary in nature: It either praises and glorifies these sharing praxes in almost messianic terms, or it criticizes them by focusing on work-leisure relations and the familiar consequences of exploiting audience work. Either way, the criticism fails to fully grasp the emancipatory potential inherent to the world of amateurs, who willfully act within the sphere of serious leisure. The article thus aims to cater to the growing need for a critical theory that neither falls into the positivistic honey trap of techno-utopian discourse, while also avoiding total negation. To this end, the article utilizes two theoretical components: serious leisure and social recognition, whose combination offers the foundations for forming an adequate critical theory.",NULL,NULL

However, the last two decades has seen the ubiquitous use of insecticides, predominantly pyrethroids, causing widespread insecticide resistance and compromising the effectiveness of vector control. Considerable efforts to develop new active ingredients and interventions are underway. However, it is essential to deploy strategies to mitigate the impact of insecticide resistance now, both to maintain the efficacy of currently available tools as well as to ensure the sustainability of new tools as they come to market. Although the World Health Organization disseminated best practice guidelines for insecticide resistance management (IRM), Rollback Malarias Vector Control Working Group identified the lack of practical knowledge of IRM as the primary gap in the translation of evidence into policy. ResistanceSim is a capacity strengthening tool designed to address this gap. The development process involved frequent stakeholder consultation, including two separate workshops. These workshops defined the learning objectives, target audience, and the role of mathematical models in the game. Software development phases were interspersed with frequent user testing, resulting in an iterative design process. User feedback was evaluated via questionnaires with Likert-scale and open-ended questions. The game was regularly evaluated by subject-area experts through meetings of an external advisory panel. Through these processes, a series of learning domains were identified and a set of specific learning objectives for each domain were defined to be communicated to vector control programme personnel. A simple game model was proposed that produces realistic outputs based on player strategy and also runs in real-time. Early testing sessions revealed numerous usability issues that prevented adequate player engagement. After extensive revisions, later testing sessions indicated that the tool would be a valuable addition to IRM training.",NULL,NULL

315,"making politics visible: discourses on gender and race in the problematisation of sex-selective abortion","This paper examines the problematisation of sex-selective abortion (SSA) in UK parliamentary debates on Fiona Bruces Abortion (Sex-Selection) Bill 201415 and on the subsequent proposed amendment to the Serious Crime Bill 201415. On the basis of close textual analysis, we argue that a discursive framing of SSA as a form of cultural oppression of minority women in need of protection underpinned Bruces Bill; in contrast, by highlighting issues more commonly articulated in defence of womens reproductiverights, the second set of debates displaced this framing in favour of a broader understanding, drawing on postcolonial feminist critiques, of how socio-economic factors constrain all women in this regard. We argue that the problematisation of SSA explains the original cross-party support for, and subsequent defeat of, the policies proposed to restrict SSA. Our analysis also highlights the central role of ideology in the policy process, thus making politics visible in policymaking.",NULL,NULL
316,"Development of a 3D, networked multi-user virtual reality environment for home therapy after stroke","Background Impairment of upper extremity function is a common outcome following stroke, to the detriment of lifestyle and employment opportunities. Yet, access to treatment may be limited due to geographical and transportation constraints, especially for those living in rural areas. While stroke rates are higher in these areas, stroke survivors in these regions of the country have substantially less access to clinical therapy. Home therapy could offer an important alternative to clinical treatment, but the inherent isolation and the monotony of self-directed training can greatly reduce compliance. Methods We developed a 3D, networked multi-user Virtual Environment for Rehabilitative Gaming Exercises (VERGE) system for home therapy. Within this environment, stroke survivors can interact with therapists and/or fellow stroke survivors in the same virtual space even though they may be physically remote. Each users own movement controls an avatar through kinematic measurements made with a low-cost, Kinect device. The system was explicitly designed to train movements important to rehabilitation and to provide real-time feedback of performance to users and clinicians. To obtain user feedback about the system, 15 stroke survivors with chronic upper extremity hemiparesis participated in a multisession pilot evaluation study, consisting of a three-week intervention in a laboratory setting. For each week, the participant performed three one-hour training sessions with one of three modalities: 1) VERGE system, 2) an existing virtual reality environment based on Alice in Wonderland (AWVR), or 3) a home exercise program (HEP). Results Over 85% of the subjects found the VERGE system to be an effective means of promoting repetitive practice of arm movement. Arm displacement averaged 350m for each VERGE training session. Arm displacement was not significantly less when using VERGE than when using AWVR or HEP. Participants were split on preference for VERGE, AWVR or HEP. Importantly, almost all subjects indicated a willingness to perform the training for at least 23days per week at home. Conclusions Multi-user VR environments hold promise for home therapy, although the importance of reducing complexity of operation for the user in the VR system must be emphasized. A modified version of the VERGE system is currently being used in a home therapy study.",NULL,NULL
317,"Automated functional upper limb evaluation of patients with Friedreich ataxia using serious games rehabilitation exercises","Background Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a disease with neurological and systemic involvement. Clinical assessment tools commonly used for FRDA become less effective in evaluating decay in patients with advanced FRDA, particularly when they are in a wheelchair. Further motor worsening mainly impairs upper limb function. In this study, we tested if serious games (SG) developed for rehabilitation can be used as an assessment tool for upper limb function even in patients with advanced FRDA. Methods A specific SG has been developed for physical rehabilitation of patients suffering from neurologic diseases. The use of this SG, coupled with Kinect sensor, has been validated to perform functional evaluation of the upper limbs with healthy subjects across lifespan. Twenty-seven FRDA patients were included in the study. Patients were invited to perform upper limb rehabilitation exercises embedded in SG. Motions were recorded by the Kinect and clinically relevant parameters were extracted from the collected motions. We tested if the existence of correlations between the scores from the serious games and the severity of the disease using clinical assessment tools commonly used for FRDA. Results of patients were compared with a group a healthy subjects of similar age. Results Very highly significant differences were found for time required to perform the exercise (increase of 76%, t(68)=7.22, P <0.001) and for accuracy (decrease of 6%, t(68)=3.69, P <0.001) between patients and healthy subjects. Concerning the patients significant correlations were found between age and time ( R =0.65, p =0.015), accuracy ( R =0.75, p =0.004) and the total displacement of upper limbs. ( R =0.55, p =0.031). Statistically significant correlations were found between the age of diagnosis and speed related parameters. Conclusions The results of this study indicate that SG reliably captures motor impairment of FRDA patients due to cerebellar and pyramidal involvement. Results also show that functional evaluation of FRDA patients can be performed during rehabilitation therapy embedded in games with the patient seated in a wheelchair. Trial registration The study was approved as a component of the EFACTS study ( Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02069509 , registered May 2010) by the local institutional Ethics Committee (ref.

318,"Music meets robotics: a prospective randomized study on motivation during robot aided therapy","Background Robots have been successfully applied in motor training during neurorehabilitation. As music is known to improve motor function and motivation in neurorehabilitation training, we aimed at integrating music creation into robotic-assisted motor therapy. We developed a virtual game-like environment with music for the arm therapy robot ARMin, containing four different motion training conditions: a condition promoting creativity (C+) and one not promoting creativity (C), each in a condition with (V+) and without (V) a visual display (i.e., a monitor). The visual display was presenting the game workspace but not contributing to the creative process itself. In all four conditions the therapy robot haptically displayed the game workspace. Our aim was to asses the effects of creativity and visual display on motivation. Methods In a prospective randomized single-center study, healthy participants were randomly assigned to play two of the four training conditions, either with (V+) or without visual display (V). In the third round, the participants played a repetition of the preferred condition of the two first rounds, this time with a new V condition (i.e., with or without visual display). For each of the three rounds, motivation was measured with the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) in the subscales interest/enjoyment, perceived choice, value/usefulness, and man-machine-relation. We recorded the actual training time, the time of free movement, and the velocity profile and administered a questionnaire to measure perceived training time and perceived effort. All measures were analysed using linear mixed models. Furthermore, we asked if the participants would like to receive the created music piece. Results Sixteen healthy subjects (ten males, six females, mean age: 27.2 years, standard deviation: 4.1 years) with no known motor or cognitive deficit participated. Promotion of creativity (i.e., C+ instead of C) significantly increased the IMI-item interest/enjoyment ( p =0.001) and the IMI-item perceived choice ( p =0.010). We found no significant effects in the IMI-items man-machine relation and value/usefulness. Conditions promoting creativity (with or without visual display) were preferred compared to the ones not promoting creativity. An interaction effect of promotion of creativity and omission of visual display was present for training time ( p =0.013) and training intensity ( p <0.001). No differences in relative perceived training time, perceived effort, and perceived value among the four training conditions were found. Conclusions Promoting creativity in a visuo-audio-haptic or audio-haptic environment increases motivation in robot-assisted therapy. We demonstrated the feasibility of performing an audio-haptic music creation task and recommend to try the system on patients with neuromuscular disorders.

319,"A system for head-neck rehabilitation exercises based on serious gaming and virtual reality","Acute and chronic neck pain are common medical conditions, and the treatment typically includes physical therapy involving daily exercises. Insufficient motivation of people afflicted with neck pain to adhere to the prescribed exercise regimen may delay their recovery. Accordingly, in this work, we propose a system that motivates the users to perform neck exercises by engaging them in a serious exergame within virtual reality (VR) environment. The system measures the users neck movements via a few static and dynamic kinematic tests and a novel VR serious game, tailored to the neck range of motion of each individual user. The game is designed to make the users perform rehabilitative neck movements according to the prescribed exercise regimen while playing. The analysis of acquired data from VR hardware provides insight into flexibility of the neck during head movements and overall neck kinematics, which is valuable for assessment of pain-related stiffness, as well as for progress monitoring. In a user study performed with the proposed system and the Oculus Rift DK2 VR headset, we show that the users find exercising more interesting and engaging when using the proposed system, and that introducing visually rich VR environments makes the users more motivated to continue exercising.",NULL,NULL
320,"A game prototype for understanding the safety issues of a lifeboat launch","Novel, advanced game techniques provide us with new possibilities to mimic a complicated training process, with the added benefit of enhanced safety. In this paper, we design and implement a 3D game with the support of virtual reality equipment which imitates the process of a lifeboat launch, involving both tractor manoeuvres and boat operations. It is a complex but vital process which can save lives at sea but also has many potential hazards. The primary objective of the game is to allow novices to better understand the sequence of the operations and manage the potential risks which may occur during the launch process. Additionally, the game has been promoted to the general public for educational purposes and to raise awareness of the safety issues involved. The key modules of the game are designed based on physical simulations to give the players enhanced plausible cognition and enjoyable interaction. We conducted two case studies for the two purposes of the games: one for training with volunteers without launching experience and the other for public awareness of the potential hazards with young children. The game is proven to be very promising for future professional training, and it serves the educational purpose of awareness of the safety issues for general public while being entertaining.",NULL,NULL
321,"The Temporal Attentive Observation (TAO) Scale: Development of an Instrument to Assess Attentive Behavior Sequences During Serious Gameplay","The engaging nature of video games has intrigued learning professionals attempting to capture and retain learners attention. Designing learning interventions that not only capture the learners attention, but also are designed around the natural cycle of attention will be vital for learning. This paper introduces the temporal attentive observation (TAO) instrument, an instrument developed to assess attentive behavior sequences during serious gameplay. We use an established three-step process for developing observational systems that includes identifying the construct, determining validity, and demonstrating practicality criteria. We conclude that the TAO instrument reliably measures attention behaviors where participants faces can be recorded during an experiment. Furthermore, we suggest that TAO should be considered as a part of an attention measurement package.",NULL,NULL
322,"Applying the information search process model to analyze aspects in the design of serious games for children with hearing impairment","Deaf children traditionally face greater challenges and encounter difficulties particular to their abilities. The Information Search Process model (ISP) is oriented in the context of the present work as a process of searching for information about children with a hearing impairment in the area of literacy, applying the different stages of the ISP model to identify different aspects of hearing impairment. A case study was carried out at the USAER school in Aguascalientes, Mexico, a school that enables children with hearing impairments to be included in regular secondary schooling. The children here are aged 1215years and have literacy problems. Eight children from 7 to 11years of age were also evaluated in the Institute for Deaf and Blind Children in Cali, Colombia. The ISP model can be deemed to have been useful for identifying the relevant needs to support both teachers and deaf children. A need was identified, to construct a game that integrates the activities undertaken following the FitzGerald keys and in turn allow them to assess learning through different activities that help increase the semantic repertoire.",NULL,NULL

This was after only a few sessions using the interactive fruit panel presented in this article. The interactive application described in this article is a way to digitize a game commonly used by ECTC therapists to help children to associate real objects (fruits in this case) with their graphical representation (pictogram) in a therapeutic activity using real objects as the interactive basis. This article describes the proposed system and analyzes the results obtained from a pilot test with real participants in collaboration with professionals from ECTC. Moreover, an empirical research has been conducted to study the benefits of the alternative communication system.

325,"See Me Roar: On the Over-Positive, Cross-Cultural Response on an AR Game for Math Learning","Todays children spend a lot of time playing digital games, but may be less interested in their schoolwork, especially for subjects they find difficult and are subsequently not willing to spend much time on it, such as mathematics. Serious games can be an effective method to improve the motivation and learning performance of children in math learning. However, current serious games have limitations in classroom applicability. Augmented Reality provides the opportunity for children to immediately visualize the assignment and can be designed to create a fantasy environment that can engage children to delve deeper into the subject. However, it is less well studied how children from different cultures react to the game design of AR learning games. Therefore, in this study, we have designed the base prototype of an AR game, called See Me Roar, aiming to improve childrens learning experience. To investigate the effect of our current base game on childrens learning motivation compared to the effect of a more traditional paper exercise, two user studies were conducted, one in China and one in an international school in the Netherlands. The results have shown that compared to a traditional paper exercise, the AR game significantly improved a number of motivational correlates, i.e. likability, enjoyment, the desire to do the exercise in free time, recommendation to others, and in general making math more fun. Both Chinese and international children prefer the game over the paper exercise. Insights regarding Self-Determination theory for the development of future versions of the game are subsequently discussed.",NULL,NULL
326,"Gamification and Serious Games Based Learning for Early Childhood in Rural Areas","Early childhood education has a high impact on the success of higher education. Besides, it allows a sustainable social and economic development of the country. It enables a relevant upbringing and education of future generations by providing the necessary skills and competencies. This is especially regarding African developing countries and rural areas in particular. Therefore, it is necessary to support the development of the early childhood education in terms of apprehending the knowledge and improving the childrens skills. Actually, recent pedagogical and neuroscience researches show that the best way to teach children is through playing, getting their attention, their engagement, receiving feedback and consolidating their skills. In fact, playing represents a natural and privileged method for childrens learning. Correspondingly, our approach integrates all aspects mentioned above to develop a playful and creative learning. The proposed approach is a play-based learning using the Montessori pedagogical principal as a core of the method that is implanted in several types of serious games. This paper proposes a Montessoris Method based on serious games solution. We developed several serious games according to an agile method. Future works will focus on deploying and validating this solution in a real context, precisely in rural preschools near Marrakech. Our aim is to evaluate the users experience and assess the childrens acceptance and usefulness of our system.",NULL,NULL

328,"Using a Serious Game to Assess Spatial Memory in Children and Adults","Short-term spatial memory has traditionally been assessed using visual stimuli, but not auditory stimuli. In this paper, we design and test a serious game with auditory stimuli for assessing short-term spatial memory. The interaction is achieved by gestures (by raising your arms). The auditory stimuli are emitted by smart devices placed at different locations. A total of 70 participants (32 children and 38 adults) took part in the study. The outcomes obtained with our game were compared with traditional methods. The results indicated that the outcomes in the game for the adults were significantly greater than those obtained by the children. This result is consistent with the assumption that the ability of humans increases continuously during maturation. Correlations were found between our game and traditional methods, suggesting its validity for assessing spatial memory. The results indicate that both groups easily learn how to perform the task and are good at recalling the locations of sounds emitted from different positions. With regard to satisfaction with our game, the mean scores of the children were higher for nearly all of the questions. The mean scores for all of the questions, except one, were greater than 4 on a scale from 1 to 5. These results show the satisfaction of the participants with our game. The results suggest that our game promotes engagement and allows the assessment of spatial memory in an ecological way.",NULL,NULL

Just Kidding in Personalised Therapy Through Natural Interactions with Games","Virtual Reality based rehabilitation is much based on sensing devices that capture and quantitatively assess the patients movements to track their progress more accurately. There are a few commercially available and affordable sensors. Among them, Kinect is an important asset to the concept of Natural User Interfaces, which is gaining a wider space and great importance in gaming for therapy approaches. These solutions can create therapy environments that increase the motivation of patients to achieve successful completion of rehabilitation programs that can be very demanding. However, therapists still demand customisable tools towards particular groups of patients. This paper presents just Physio kidding, which is a solution based on the use of serious games, natural user interfaces and personalisation to address both physiotherapy and cognitive stimulation therapy.

330,"An Application to Promote Emotional Skills in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders","This paper presents an approach regarding the use of a serious game with a playware object to improve the development of emotional skills in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The playware object is an interactive way for the user to play the game. It acts as the game controller, has six buttons, each displaying an emoji with a different facial expression, and communicates wirelessly with the android device through Bluetooth. For this purpose, the six facial expressions tested are happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise and a neutral/normal, which were implemented in three different game activities: imitation, recognition, and storytelling. The avatars used in the game to represent these facial expressions were first validated through an on-line questionnaire (with 114 answers) with a mean success rate of 96.2%. In order to assess the usability of the game and the playware object, a test was performed with six typically developing children, with 94.4% answer accuracy. At last, the recognition activity was tested with six children with ASD during three/four sessions. Due to the small group test and the short number of sessions, the goal was to test the acceptance of the game rather than the users improvement in the activity. It is worth referring that both the serious game and the playware object had a high level of approval from the children and they expressed their interest during the activities. With this preliminary study its intended to contribute to the development of pedagogical resources to be used by professionals and families in the support of children with ASD.",NULL,NULL

The games contain preventive information, supported by graphics which describe secure behavior, possible consequences of accidents and some elements that the child needs to avoid, immerse in childrens common sceneries as home and school. A familiar character (dog) was implemented to create a reference of security in children, so they could be able to associate all the information presented, in one figure. The tool was tested with two groups of regular school students from third to fifth grade. 31 children assisted to a traditional workshop, including physical ludic activities to transmit preventive information about accidents, and 30, learnt through the informatics application. Finally, students were evaluated through a brief questionnaire. In a preliminary analysis, results showed a higher impact on the group that used the informatics application, overpassing the traditional workshop with 6% points. To verify this, the results of the different topics of the workshops: pedestrian accidents, burns and intoxication, were averaged, evidencing a precision of 73.14% for the traditional workshop, and 79.72% for the one using the application. This result will be complemented in the future, with a second analysis of variables, to determine the relationship between the elements of the virtual games and the effectiveness of the achieved learning.",NULL,NULL
332,"Using Serious Games for Promoting Blended Learning for People with Intellectual Disabilities and Autism: Literature vs Reality","Educating people with intellectual disabilities (ID) or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a non-trivial process and differs from the learning methods of typically developed people. Recently, serious games (SGs) have been used to enhance the learning process of these groups and address different skills. On the other hand, blended learning (BL) is applied to formal and informal educational contexts and combines face-to-face and online learning. In this study, we examine if SGs can provide the necessary means for applying BL, especially for people with ID or ASD that could be benefited by personalized learning opportunities. In addition, we examine 43 existing SGs for people with ID or ASD, as well as the perceptions of 93 special education professionals (SEP) and teachers (SET) working in schools and institutions for people with ID or ASD regarding the role of technology and SGs in their education. We concluded that SGs could enhance the learning process of people with ID or ASD in many skills. In addition, the opinions of SEP and SET regarding the importance of technology in the learning process of people with ID or ASD and the familiarity with SGs, indicate that BL could be effectively promoted through SGs.",NULL,NULL

334,"Exploring In-Game Reward Mechanisms in Diaquarium A Serious Game for Children with Type 1 Diabetes","When developing serious games for health, the main goal is to use game mechanisms in a way that the users decide to extend their playing time, complete all levels within the game, and thereby gain progression and intended learning with regard to disease management. One major concern when developing games for health is, therefore, the possibility of users who withdraw from the game before completed. A game, with a rapid descending popularity and users quitting gameplay early, fails to provide medical education to patients and is thus useless. For that reason, motivational game elements, such as in-game rewards, have been heavily used when designing serious games. This paper identifies and suggests several reinforcement mechanisms within serious games and explores how they can be applied in diabetes. The game called Diaquarium, a serious game for children with Type 1 diabetes, provides knowledge regarding how nutrition, blood glucose levels, and insulin interplay for this patient group. A prototype has been developed to demonstrate its concept and some game mechanisms with help of Unity 3D game engine and the C# programming language. Game design, requirements and suggestions for the project, were gathered through literature review, attending workshops, meetings and discussions with experts, as well as feedback from a related user group through a questionnaire. The questionnaire was distributed to an elementary school class, involving nine 9-year-old children. The questionnaire examined and collected feedback regarding the game outline, usability, and preferred reward mechanisms in the Diaquarium game. Despite a short period of testing and a limited test group with non-diabetic children, the game was recognized as attractive and moderately difficult within the potential user group. The analysis suggests that rewards are highly a matter of preference. Simultaneously, there were indications that some of the rewards were more favorable than others. It appears that rewards serving a purpose within the game, e.g., potentially effect progression in the gameplay, are more favorable than the opposite rewards serving no purpose. The findings were highly valued and taken into consideration during the design process of exploring the in-game rewards of the Diaquarium.",NULL,NULL

Commercial videogame developers have been learning from their players through Game Analytics for years via non-disruptive game tracking. In this paper, we propose a methodology for assessing serious game effectiveness based on non-disruptive in-game tracking. The methodology involves a design pattern that structures the delivery of educational goals through a game. This structure also allows one to infer learning outcomes for each individual player, which, when aggregated, determine the effectiveness of a serious game.

349,"Learning Curve Analysis in a Large-Scale, Drill-and-Practice Serious Math Game: Where Is Learning Support Needed?","This paper applies data-driven methods to understand learning and derives game design insights in a large-scale, drill-and-practice game: Spatial Temporal (ST) Math. In order for serious games to thrive we must develop efficient, scalable methods to evaluate games against their educational goals. Learning models have matured in recent years and have been applied across e-learning platforms but they have not been used widely in serious games. We applied empirical learning curve analyses to ST Math under different assumptions of how knowledge components are defined in the game and map to game contents. We derived actionable game design feedback and educational insights regarding fraction learning. Our results revealed cases where students failed to transfer knowledge between math skills, content, and problem representations. This work stresses the importance of designing games that support students comprehension of math concepts, rather than the learning of content- and situation-specific skills to pass games.",NULL,NULL
350,"An Approach to Mobile Serious Games Accessibility Assessment for People with Hearing Impairments","Serious games allow educating in a fun way in different areas and its development in mobile devices has been growing since the advent of smartphones. However, accessibility for people with hearing impairments has not been considered as a necessary element in the development of this type of video games. Unfortunately, there is no model for assessing the accessibility of serious games for people with hearing impairments, although some video games development companies recommend general guidelines for the construction of these applications. This paper presents a compilation and analysis of the current accessibility guidelines for the development of video games for people with hearing impairments. As a case study, an assessment of a mobile game is made to identify its level of accessibility. An analysis tool for those who wish to develop or evaluate serious games for people with hearing impairments on mobile devices is proposed.",NULL,NULL
351,"A Serious Game to Promote Environmental Attitude","Environmental attitudes are essential for the todays world in which shrinking natural resources and pollution are one of the biggest problems of the society. The research challenges go in two directions: on the one hand, the environmental researchers try to reduce the impact of human actions on the environment and, on the other, human researchers try to educate people to adopt ecological behaviour. This is the main issue faced in this research to sensitize young people to the environmental health using multimedia technologies. The paper presents a serious game addressed to primary school pupils aimed at transferring knowledge about marine litter and four species of Mediterranean Sea that are estimated to be at risk of extinction. The aim is to foster knowledge about the marine life and to explain people the problems that marine litter can cause. The results of a pilot study that investigates the usability of the game is presented.",NULL,NULL
352,"An Overview of Location-Based Game Authoring Tools for Education","Nowadays, computer literacy is common at a very early age. As mobile devices and new social communication trends are increasingly integrating in the modern digital lifestyle new opportunities arise for harnessing this potential for innovative serious purposes. Location-based games that layer educational activities with game play can help players gain a new perspective through active engagement. In this paper, a range of key issues for implementing location based games for educational purposes using the two most commonly used open source authoring tools ARIS and TaleBlazer are presented. Although the reviewed authoring tools vary in functionality, they share a fairly common conceptual model and in both cases the software architecture is comprised of the same components. Both platforms provide the required game mechanics to create sophisticated gameplay interactions and game logic extension. However, a number of issues should be carefully considered. The conceptual models are analyzed with a critical view, pointing out limitations and challenges that can inform the design and implementation of next generation authoring tools.",NULL,NULL
353,"Games for Knowledge Transfer and as a Stimulus for Climate Change Mitigation in AgricultureLessons Learned from a Game Prototype","Transferring complex scientific knowledge into practice is challenging. This is also the case for know-how on climate change (CC) mitigation in the agricultural sector, which is held responsible for approximately 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Even though numerous mitigation options at the farm level have already been identified, they still lack broad implementation. Serious games have increasingly gained attention as a medium for knowledge transfer on CC mitigation. This paper analyses if such games are also helpful for the transfer of mitigation and adaption knowledge to the actors of the agricultural sector. The paper starts with a short introduction of characteristics of serious games, and an overview of published games on CC with a focus on agriculture. It then presents a game prototype where the players act as farmers who invest a given budget into their choice of CC mitigation measures. Yet, the prototype focuses on mitigation in industrialized agriculture. It was exemplarily played by different target groups (interested lay people, stakeholders). The paper qualitatively presents lessons learned from this attempt to communicate the complex topic via a game approach. These include accounting for previous knowledge, and safeguarding of core messages. This paper might help others who are considering games as a way to communicate their findings.",NULL,NULL
354,"Characterization of the Serious Games Applied to the Historical Heritage","At present, interest in the dissemination and appropriation of cultural heritage has increased considerably, seeking to understand the history of the people and make it socially valued. To achieve this goal, technology has become a tool that allows venture and innovate strategies and tools that support these processes of socialization. In this sense serious games, constitute a tool that provides added value to the game, plus the amuse. In the process of dissemination of cultural heritage, serious games are used for events and historical facts of which the ancestors were protagonists are known. In this paper, the results of a process of exploration and systematic review of different games focused on the theme, presenting the characteristics and priority and relevant elements for a serious game used in the dissemination of historical heritage meets the objective of socialized educate, inform and entertain the user, without forgetting the important role of transmitting the culture of the place and training with the inclusion of technologies. Another result, serious games can be placed as critical elements in which the quality of cultural learning is assumed, that is why it is of great interest to apply a model with the specific characteristics and elements that ensure quality and main objective of a serious patrimonial and historical games.",NULL,NULL
355,"Game Over or Jumping to the Next Level? How Playing the Serious Game Mobility Safari Instigates Social Learning for a Smart Mobility Transition in Vienna","Serious games and gaming are increasingly considered as the magic bullet for improved stakeholder involvement and citizen engagement in urban planning and governance. They are also discussed as means to instigate learning and capacity building and to raise the awareness of citizens and stakeholders about various urban topics. These learning processes can unfold in various different formats, such as social or game-based learning. This chapter investigates if playing the serious game prototype Mobility Safari supports such processes. Mobility Safari is a serious-game prototype developed for the City of Vienna. The game is targeting Viennas ambition to become a smart city. One focal point of this ambition concerns the change towards a more sustainable mobility system. Our analysis illustrates that the serious game indeed evokes learning processes during the gameplay and the debriefing, covering a broad range of learning activities and social interaction. Incomplete rule-sets and un-governed situations trigger discussions in which players confront the game experience with their actual real-world practices. Our analysis suggests that games are indeed suitable means for informing citizens and supporting capacity-building processes in participatory-planning approaches. However, they need a careful design, facilitation and sufficient time for a debriefing so that players can reflect on the game experience. This reflection is crucial to transform the game experience into a deeper learning experience that is meaningful for real-world contexts.",NULL,NULL

However, despite decades of security research, users continue to choose easy-to-guess passwords to protect their important online accounts. In this paper, we explore the potential of serious games to educate users about various features that negatively impact password security. Specifically, we designed a web-based casual game called GAP and assessed its impact by conducting a comparative user study with 119 participants. The study results show that participants who played GAP demonstrated improved performance in recognizing insecure password features than participants who did not play GAP . Besides having educational value, most of the participants also found GAP fun to play.",NULL,NULL
357,"A Hybrid Virtual-Augmented Serious Game to Improve Driving Safety Awareness","The use of 3D virtual content and Augmented Reality (AR) in certain applications allows designing tools and serious games that are more attractive to the potential users. Focusing on the area of learning and education, these technologies can be adapted to the requirements of the application that needs to be developed, to the available devices on which they are expected to run and also to the learning content. However, in most applications only a single interaction paradigm and a single visualization mode is used, restricting the potential benefits of the system. In this paper, we propose a software application designed to improve driving safety awareness and learning for both adults and children, in which we combine different interaction and visualization modes. The application is shaped as a hybrid virtual-augmented Game of the Goose in which AR, tactile interaction and 3D virtual content are brought to the user in a combined but meaningful way. The combination of these different interaction paradigms creates an educational tool which is much more intuitive and engaging. In this serious game, multiple players/users can participate simultaneously and players obtain, on the one hand, an intuitive interaction, simple and realistic based on AR and, on the other hand, an increase in the sense of immersion by means of virtual content, for a given set of driving-related situations. This provides a much more tailored learning system, making the users focus in the given driving situations. The paper describes the objectives set in the development of the application, the design and implementation decisions taken and a comprehensive but preliminary assessment performed with 285 users which provides satisfactory and promising results.",NULL,NULL
358,"The Effect of Emotions and Social Behavior on Performance in a Collaborative Serious Game Between Humans and Autonomous Robots","The aim of this paper is to investigate performance in a collaborative humanrobot interaction on a shared serious game task. Furthermore, the effect of elicited emotions and perceived social behavior categories on players performance will be investigated. The participants collaboratively played a turn-taking version of the Tower of Hanoi serious game, together with the human and robot collaborators. The elicited emotions were analyzed in regards to the arousal and valence variables, computed from the Geneva Emotion Wheel questionnaire. Moreover, the perceived social behavior categories were obtained from analyzing and grouping replies to the Interactive Experiences and Trust and Respect questionnaires. It was found that the results did not show a statistically significant difference in participants performance between the human or robot collaborators. Moreover, all of the collaborators elicited similar emotions, where the human collaborator was perceived as more credible and socially present than the robot one. It is suggested that using robot collaborators might be as efficient as using human ones, in the context of serious game collaborative tasks.",NULL,NULL
359,"Using Serious Game for Children and Youth Education in Sustainable Energy Field and Environment Protection","Lately, it has been demonstrated that the use of serious game in the education of children and youth can open new opportunities for transmission of information and development of technical skills. For this, increasingly more educational environments apply to the transmission of information, knowledge and technical systems development by making practical or virtual applications, like serious game, in which our children or students can dynamically participate. In this paper, in the first part, the principles of the concept of partnership development through mentoring by which wanted students involvement in educational effective and understanding practical activities, also application aspects of environmental protection and efficient use of sources of green energy are presented. In the second part of paper, the concept was materialized in the design, implementation and use of checkerboard constructed from recoverable materials and green energy sources. Youth participation, both in design and in finding practical solutions for construction and the propagation of information about the environment or energy sources, for young students having the same age with them were the main objectives of this approach.

360,"A Serious Game for Learning Portuguese Sign Language - iLearnPSL","Several thousands of people in Portugal use Portuguese sign language (PSL). Children belonging to this community have difficulties with communication and learning processes. There are some applications that focuses on teaching/learning PSL but with a limited interaction with the user, such as presentation of images of a hand gesture picture or avatar where the user must mimic the respective PSL hand gesture. Some other applications are more advanced using sensors to detect movements and gestures performed by the user. However, these applications do not implement an automatic interaction with the user of PSL. Following this trend, the main idea of this project is to develop a solution where deaf child can learn PSL in an interactive, dynamic and funny way. Therefore, this paper describes the first insights in the development of an interactive and didactic virtual game tool to learn the Portuguese Sign Language, in particular the numbers from 0 to 9. The alphabet and colors will be also included in the future. The target group considers deaf children in the first cycle of education level (primary Portuguese school). The developed game promotes the automatic interaction with the user through the Leap Motion controller. The system captures the hands and fingers gestures performed by the user and the graphical interface returns the adequate feedback. The preliminary results obtained show a good level of user experience with therapists.",NULL,NULL

362,"Perspectives on Design of Sensor Based Exergames Targeted Towards Older Adults","Serious games are an established field of study, where exergames provide a combination of conducting exercises and playing games. The aim of this work was to identify important features to include in, and design recommendations for exergames using sensor technology. The outcome of this work was two-folded. Firstly, a literature review of design guidelines with respect to older adults as users of exergames resulted in a categorized summary of design guidelines for specific target groups, e.g. people undergoing physical rehabilitation after stroke or injury or users suffering from a chronic disease. Secondly, these guidelines are discussed from various perspectives, based on insights from several years of work in the area. A general design guidelines covered by most of the literature is that exergames should provide a wide range of difficulty levels and be possible to adjust to individual needs. Insights from own work in the area highlight the importance of task and context relevant tools and devices. The result will serve as a starting point for a framework consisting of both general and domain specific design guidelines when designing sensor-based exergames for older adults.",NULL,NULL

365,"A Management Model for Effective Team Communication in Business Simulation Games","The scientific aim of this research is to define how to manage communication effectiveness in teamwork in highly complex and dynamic problem-solving settings. Existing studies on communication processes and teamwork effectiveness are quite numerous but do not offer any coherent results nor precise conclusions regarding communicative effectiveness in teams for business games contexts. This stems not only from the variety of scientific fields examining this matter but also from the differences in paradigms and methods employed. Also important is the fact that the relationship between group processes and teamwork effectiveness derives from highly complex and multileveled phenomena and processes. Thus, there is a need to embrace a dynamic, process-oriented approach. Previous research in this field is based on static diagnosis, meaning: on observation or diagnosis of states at different time-points and comparison between the two. There is very little research on teamwork effectiveness focusing on tracking (1) the waving of communication processes in time and (2) the adaptive dynamics in the teamwork course. This research was aimed at testing a method that would make it possible to develop such an approach, and it resulted in the emergence of a behavioral pattern in the examined teams. Based on that, the authors elaborate a management model for an effective communication management process at the team level.",NULL,NULL

However, designing games for elderly poses distinctive challenges since one has to take into account the limited experience of todays elderly with digital gameplay interfaces like touch screens that are second-nature to younger players. In this paper we present an initial user study with young and healthy subjects where we evaluate a computer-vision based digitalization process that is necessary to turn a physical version of the board game Ludo into an automated assessment tool. We further evaluate to which extend this tool presents a valid alternative to assess the strategic cognitive capabilities of a person. We have chosen Ludo in its physical form after careful consideration together with elderly and caregivers since many elderlies know this game from their childhood and thus do not need to learn new game rules or to adapt to digital environment.",NULL,NULL

The study is based on a formative evaluation with questionnaires, observations, data logging, and interviews. Interviews with classical civilization teachers were further conducted, both in the initial design stage and after participant tests. Through all stages of the transmedia storytelling, it was revealed that curiosity was the main reason behind the engagement. The aesthetics worked out well in the game, and the story was presented in a format that the boys could comprehend and had the potential to increase their engagement in reading the poem. Different elements were implemented in the program code to maintain match in game flow for the individual player. However, this study can also emphasize how well-designed game mechanics are of ultimate importance, as well as involving teachers throughout all stages in the iterative process, as they are key figures for real implementation and acceptance.",NULL,NULL

Case Study Analysis","Preferred team role composition is said to influence team work effectiveness and communication patterns within teams. It is often recommended to balance team members in terms of socio-emotional and task-oriented preferred roles. However results obtained during this study indicate that there might not be such a possibility in the managerial environment. Hereby we present case studies of two extremely unbalanced teams in terms of socio-emotional and task-oriented role preference and its relationship with communication patterns in teamwork effectiveness. As suggested by literature, neither of these extremities is fully beneficial in terms of game play results. However it seems that a team consisting of only task-oriented participants performed better than purely socio-emotional oriented team.

377,"3D Interaction with Mouse-Keyboard, Gamepad and Leap Motion: AComparative Study","Serious gaming can represent a key for fostering learning and letting children to acquire new information and skills while doing engaging activities. Among the different types of games, those ones based on interactive 3D environments are widely diffused and appreciated. A key component of the design of these experiences is the choice of the input device that will be used by the players and the mapping of the users intentions to the actions in the 3D environment. The choice of the proper device can lead to benefits in terms of user engagement, which often is the prerequisite for learning. There are also additional dimensions to consider, as the usability and the physical fatigue. Their undervaluation, in an educational context, can hamper the successful outcome of the experience. For this reason in this work we compared the use of three different input devices (a mouse-keyboard set, a gamepad and the Leap Motion, a sensor for recognizing hand gestures) for controlling a 3D educational gaming experience focused on environmental sustainability. We organized a comparative study with 30 children of the Primary School, evaluating the interaction in terms of usability, engagement and physical fatigue. The results evidenced the potential of the Leap for engaging the children, but also drawbacks in terms of usability and physical fatigue that should be taken into consideration for the development of this technology and the design of experiences based on it.",NULL,NULL

Automated facial expression recognition is a promising approach and has implications for assistive and educational technologies, too. This study was an initial exploration of (1) the inter-rater reliability of human recognition of facial emotions of high functioning (HF) children with ASC; (2) the relationship between human and automated recognition of facial emotions; and (3) a bottom-up approach on identifying ASC/typical development (TD) differences, from a screening serious game context. Thirteen HF, kindergarten-age children with ASC and 13 children with TD, matched along age and IQ, participated. Emotion recognition was administered on video-recordings from sessions of their playing with the serious game. Results showed lack of inter-rater reliability in human coding, confirming some advantages of machine coding. The simple bottom-up cross-sectional exploratory analysis did not reveal any ASC/TD difference. This is in contrast with our and others previous results, indicating such differences when aggregating emotion data from wider time-windows in machine-coded data-sets. This suggests that this second approach may be a more promising one to identify autism-specific emotion expression patterns.",NULL,NULL

Currently, traditional measures are showing limitations in capturing real life behaviors and new technologies, such as serious games, are allowing creating more real situations with higher ecological validity. In the present study, we applied a serious game approach to investigate individual variables-related differences in the EF assessment. 268 healthy subjects participated in the study, completing 14 tasks (6 standard tasks; 8 serious games) randomly presented. The results showed that younger participants completed tasks in less time than older and with higher correct answers. Furthermore, males registered shorter reaction times, while females showed higher percentages of correct answers. The university studies group obtained higher total score and correct answers than high school studies group. Finally, since the study involved technology, we divided the group in high and low use technology level, obtaining that participants with a lower level of use technologies reported higher latency times and lower correct answers in high order EF tasks than the group with higher level of use of technology. As the traditional measure, these findings suggest that individuals differences are critical variables to consider in the development of more ecological measures for the assessment of EFs.",NULL,NULL

Based on the analysis results, we established a database for recommendation of game level in the next training session. Attention is further subdivided into selective, sustained and divided attention. Memory is subcategorized into topological memory, associative memory, verbal memory, immediate memory, visual short-term memory, working memory and recall memory. Executive function is classified into inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility and working memory. ADL includes physical ADL and instrumental ADL. This model comprises a total of 19 serious games for cognitive rehabilitation and each game consists of 3 levels of increasing difficulty. Game interface is created with a user-centered design which focuses on visualization for elderly-friendly use. Our integrated management service model for cognitive rehabilitation can provide training on cognitive function in different areas as a single program and recommend the difficulty level of games depending on players ability.",NULL,NULL
387,"Cultural Neuroscience and the Military: Applications, Perspectives, Controversies","As we are entering the golden age of brain research and the Biotechnological Revolution in Military Affairs (BIOTECH RMA), not only civilian entities in research endeavors such as the American BRAIN initiative or the European Human Brain Project , but also security and defense communities start exploring the cognitive area of human activity. Brain research, however, due to numerous technological and other limitations, does not cover the complexity of the mind, and the cultural variety of the individuals involved. Culturally influenced cognitive, affective and even physical domains embrace emotional antecedents, conditioning, moral reasoning, perception and gaining situational awareness, communication, approach to death, somatic health, aggression, responding to narratives, group relations and many others. However, only a limited amount of other research has been performed and reported on in this aspect. Therefore, the chapter analyzes the existing evidence on the culture-brain nexus and its numerous implications for human functioning in a variety of domains, reviews the existing solutions and projects that leading military institutions already realize in the cognitive field, and in the light of newest findings of cultural neuroscience, proposes new potential solutions and enhancements for the design and conduct of military training and conduct of non-kinetic aspects of military operations. The aim of the research piece is to expand on the added value of the cultural neuroscience research to the field, and to discuss the resulting reservations and controversies of a situation in which winning hearts and minds might no longer be a metaphor.",NULL,NULL
388,"Virtual Reality in the Learning Process","Knowledge is essential and experience teaches. Therefore, new learning trends in schools are based on experience, making use of technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR) that allow to experience situations that are very close to reality. However, unlike computers, this technology does not present the same level of integration in schools. This article presents a systematic literature review of research conducted into virtual reality and the learning process in order to identify the important characteristics of virtual reality technology and its effect on the learning process. A total of 30 articles published between 1999 and 2017 were selected. The results show that the characteristics of interaction and immersion are the most important to consider in a virtual reality technology and its implementation would support the learning process.",NULL,NULL
389,"Food safety and nutrition how to prepare for a challenging future? New approaches for using scenarios for policy-making","Scenarios are a well-established methodology used in foresight. In this paper a three-phased process is described to maximise relevance for policy-making of a set of scenarios. As a first step, four scenarios were developed as a basis for the assessment of the ability of the EUs legislative and policy framework on food safety and nutrition to deal with possible future challenges. In the second step the scenarios were analysed by stakeholders to identify the scenario-specific challenge profiles in terms of food safety and nutrition. Policy and regulatory responses were formulated towards improving the fitness of the EU food framework for the future. The pertinence and realism of this exercise generated questions about how the role of the EU policy maker in this area could develop. To answer this question, in a third step, a new tailor-made approach was developed, allowing exploring and testing policy-making under diverse circumstances. The serious gaming platform, the Joint Research Centres Scenario Exploration System, was adapted and applied with a number of selected stakeholders. Both approaches, each on their own, demonstrated the power of scenarios for simulating realistic policy circumstances. In combination, the process allowed to examine, in systemic way, different aspects of future policies and fostering a more forward-looking mind-set to inform practical policy-making.",NULL,NULL
390,"Linking serious game narratives with pedagogical theories and pedagogical design strategies","Narrative-based serious games present pedagogical content and interventions through an interactive narrative. To ensure effective learning in such kind of serious games, designers are not only faced with the challenge of creating a compelling narrative, but also with the additional challenge of incorporating suitable pedagogical strategies. Therefore, development teams must consist of a multidisciplinary group including storytellers, technical staff and pedagogical experts to make sure that suitable pedagogical strategies are incorporated into the narrative. In this paper, the authors show how the Domain Specific Modeling Language ATTAC-L, for modeling the narrative of a serious game, allows creating the link between the processes of pedagogical design and narrative modeling by means of an elaborate annotation system. As such, this modeling language enables different experts to concentrate on the aspects related to their field of expertise without losing oversight of the serious game as a whole. More in particular, we will show how the annotation system can be used to document and integrate the use of a well-grounded pedagogical theory, Social Cognitive Theory, for achieving the goals of a serious game, as well as when the serious game is part of a program developed by means of a well-grounded design strategy, Intervention Mapping Protocol.",NULL,NULL

Project Sanitarium is a serious game for Windows PC and Tablet which aims to embed learning about tuberculosis (TB) through the player taking on the role of a doctor and solving cases across the globe. The project developed as a collaboration between staff and undergraduate students at the School of Arts, Media and Computer Games at Abertay University working with academics and researchers from the Infection Group at the University of St Andrews. The project also engaged industry partners Microsoft and DeltaDNA. The project aimed to educate students through a workplace simulation pedagogical model, encourage public engagement at events and through news coverage and lastly to prototype whether games could be used to simulate a virtual clinical trial. The project was embedded in the Abertay undergraduate programme where students are presented with real world problems to solve through design and technology. The result was a serious game prototype that utilized game design techniques and technology to demystify and educate players about the diagnosis and treatment of one of the worlds oldest and deadliest diseases, TB. Project Sanitarium aims to not only educate the player, but allows the player to become a part of a simulated drug trial that could potentially help create new treatments in the fight against TB. The game incorporates a mathematical model that is based on data from real-world drug trials. The interdisciplinary pedagogical model provides undergraduates with workplace simulation, wider industry collaboration and access to academic expertise to solve challenging and complex problems.",NULL,NULL

393,"Understanding the experience of initiating community-based physical activity and social support by people with serious mental illness: a systematic review using a meta-ethnographic approach","Background People with long-term serious mental illness live with severe and debilitating symptoms that can negatively influence their health and quality of life, leading to outcomes such as premature mortality, morbidity and obesity. An interplay of social, behavioural, biological and psychological factors is likely to contribute to their poor physical health. Participating in regular physical activity could bring symptomatic improvements, weight loss benefits, enhanced wellbeing and when undertaken in a community-based group setting can yield additional, important social support benefits. Yet poor uptake of physical activity by people with serious mental illness is a problem. This review will systematically search, appraise and synthesise the existing evidence that has explored the experience of community-based physical activity initiation and key features of social support within these contexts by adults with schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, major depressive disorder or psychosis using the meta-ethnography approach. This new understanding may be key in designing more acceptable and effective community-based group PA programmes that meet patients need and expectations. Methods This will be a systematic review of qualitative studies using the meta-ethnography approach. The following databases will be searched: ASSIA, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, Health Technology Assessment Database, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, SPORTDiscus and Web of Science. Grey literature will also be sought. Eligible studies will use qualitative methodology; involve adults (18years) with schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, major depressive disorder or psychosis; will report community-based group physical activity; and capture the experience of physical activity initiation and key features of social support from the perspective of the participant. Study selection and assessment of quality will be performed by two reviewers. Data will be extracted by one reviewer, tabled, and checked for accuracy by the second reviewer. The meta-ethnography approach by Noblit and Hare (Meta-ethnography: synthesizing qualitative studies 11, 1988) will be used to synthesise the data. Discussion This systematic review is expected to provide new insights into the experience of community-based group physical activity initiation for adults who have a serious mental illness to inform person-centred improvements to the management of serious mental illness through physical activity.

However, there has been a lack of in-depth discussion of the teacher role in the course of serious gaming when it is adopted in formal schooling. The study discussed in this paper is a piece of two-cycle design-based research, involving three teachers respectively from top, middle and bottom academic banding schools in Hong Kong and their Grade 11 classes in two consecutive school years (197 students in total). In the context of formal curriculum learning and teaching, we (researchers) collaborated with the teachers (practitioners) to investigate (design, enact, analyse and redesign) what and how they should do in order to optimise their students serious gaming process and advance the pedagogic effectiveness of serious gaming in different classroom settings.",NULL,NULL
395,"Evaluation of cervical posture improvement of children with cerebral palsy after physical therapy based on head movements and serious games","Background This paper presents the preliminary results of a novel rehabilitation therapy for cervical and trunk control of children with cerebral palsy (CP) based on serious videogames and physical exercise. Materials The therapy is based on the use of the ENLAZA Interface, a head mouse based on inertial technology that will be used to control a set of serious videogames with movements of the head. Methods Ten users with CP participated in the study. Whereas the control group (n=5) followed traditional therapies, the experimental group (n=5) complemented these therapies with a series of ten sessions of gaming with ENLAZA to exercise cervical flexionextensions, rotations and inclinations in a controlled, engaging environment. Results The ten work sessions yielded improvements in head and trunk control that were higher in the experimental group for Visual Analogue Scale, Goal Attainment Scaling and Trunk Control Measurement Scale (TCMS). Significant differences (27% vs. 2% of percentage improvement) were found between the experimental and control groups for TCMS (p<0.05). The kinematic assessment shows that there were some improvements in the active and the passive range of motion. However, no significant differences were found pre- and post-intervention. Conclusions Physical therapy that combines serious games with traditional rehabilitation could allow children with CP to achieve larger function improvements in the trunk and cervical regions. However, given the limited scope of this trial (n=10) additional studies are needed to corroborate this hypothesis.",NULL,NULL
396,"Emotiplay: a serious game for learning about emotions in children with autism: results of a cross-cultural evaluation","Children with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) experience difficulties recognizing others emotions and mental states. It has been shown that serious games (SG) can produce simplified versions of the socio-emotional world. The current study performed a cross-cultural evaluation (in the UK, Israel and Sweden) of Emotiplays SG, a system aimed to teach emotion recognition (ER) to children with ASC in an entertaining, and intrinsically motivating way. Participants were 69year olds with high functioning ASC who used the SG for 812weeks. Measures included face, voice, body, and integrative ER tasks, as well as parent-reported level of autism symptoms, and adaptive socialization. In the UK, 15 children were tested before and after using the SG. In Israel ( n =38) and Sweden ( n =36), children were randomized into a SG or a waiting list control group. In the UK, results revealed that 8weeks of SG use significantly improved participants performance on ER body language and integrative tasks. Parents also reported their children improved their adaptive socialization. In Israel and Sweden, participants using the SG improved significantly more than controls on all ER measures. In addition, parents in the Israeli SG group reported their children showed reduced autism symptoms after using the SG. In conclusion, Emotiplays SG is an effective and motivating psycho-educational intervention, cross-culturally teaching ER from faces, voices, body language, and their integration in context to children with high functioning ASC. Local evidence was found for more generalized gains to socialization and reduced autism symptoms.",NULL,NULL
397,"Serious storytelling a first definition and review","In human culture, storytelling is a long-established tradition. The reasons people tell stories are manifold: to entertain, to transfer knowledge between generations, to maintain cultural heritage, or to warn others of dangers. With the emergence of the digitisation of media, many new possibilities to tell stories in serious and non-entertainment contexts emerged. A very simple example is the idea of serious gaming, as in, digital games without the primary purpose of entertainment. In this paper, we introduce the term serious storytelling as a new potential media genre  defining serious storytelling as storytelling with a purpose beyond entertainment. We also put forward a review of existing potential application areas, and develop a framework for serious storytelling. We foresee several application areas for this fundamental concept, including wellbeing and health, medicine, psychology, education, ethical problem solving, e-leadership and management, qualitative journalism, serious digital games, simulations and virtual training, user experience studies, and online communication.",NULL,NULL
398,"Acquiring Critical Thinking and Decision-Making Skills: An Evaluation of a Serious Game Used by Undergraduate Dental Students in Dental Public Health","Serious gaming claims to provide an interactive and motivational approach to learning; hence, it is being increasingly used in various disciplines, including dentistry. GRAPHIC (Games Research Applied to Public Health with Innovative Collaboration)-II, a serious game for dental public health, was used by dental undergraduates at Kings College London, in the 20132014 academic year. The aim was to explore the use of GRAPHIC and student perspectives on the game. Students were divided into two groups with 79 students in each group, based on timetabling schedules to use the game as part of their learning. The average number of submission attempts by students in group 1 and group 2 used to complete the game was 18.3 (SD=14.45) and 8.9 (SD=16.80), respectively ( p <0.001). Logged data also showed that more students in group 2 completed the game with only one attempt ( n =23), compared with group 1 ( n =4). Amongst these students there were four different patterns of satisfactory answers which constituted their chance to win and a range of times. Across the two groups, a number of students completed the game with a high number (>30) of attempts ( n =18). These findings suggest that whilst some students may have completed the game using a collaborative approach, others may have used a random approach to complete the game. These two strategies are considered to hinder students from achieving learning outcomes within the game, and may be related to the limitations of the game in managing the role of failure. Feedback from students towards the game was positive overall with further development suggested. In summary, GRAPHIC contributed to dental public health education, and the logging system of gaming activities can be considered as a helpful feature of serious games, to permit academic staff to identify and assist students in achieving learning outcomes, and inform future game refinement.",NULL,NULL
399,"The effects of a psychological intervention directed at optimizing immune function: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial","Background Previous research has provided evidence for the link between psychological processes and psychophysiological health outcomes. Psychological interventions, such as face-to-face or online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and serious games aimed at improving health, have shown promising results in promoting health outcomes. Few studies so far, however, have examined whether Internet-based CBT combined with serious gaming elements is effective in modulating health outcomes. Moreover, studies often did not incorporate psychophysiological or immunological challenges in order to gain insight into physiological responses to real-life challenges after psychological interventions. The overall aim of this study is to investigate the effects of a psychological intervention on self-reported and physiological health outcomes in response to immune and psychophysiological challenges. Methods/design In a randomized controlled trial, 60 healthy men are randomly assigned to either an experimental condition, receiving guided Internet-based (e-health) CBT combined with health-related serious gaming elements for 6weeks, or a control condition receiving no intervention. After the psychological intervention, self-reported vitality is measured, and participants are given an immunological challenge in the form of a Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Gurin (BCG) vaccination. One day after the vaccination, participants are asked to perform several psychophysiological tasks in order to explore the effects of the psychological intervention on participants stress response following the immune challenge. To assess the delayed effects of vaccination on self-reported and physiological health outcomes, a follow-up visit is planned 4weeks later. Total study duration is approximately 14weeks. The primary outcome measure is self-reported vitality measured directly after the intervention. Secondary outcome measures include inflammatory and endocrine markers, as well as psychophysiological measures of heart rate and skin conductance in response to the psychophysiological tasks after the BCG vaccination. Discussion The innovative design features of this study  e.g., combining guided e-health CBT with health-related serious gaming elements and incorporating immunological and psychophysiological challenges  will provide valuable information on the effects of a psychological intervention on both self-reported and physiological health outcomes. This study will offer further insights into the mechanisms underlying the link between psychological factors and health outcomes and is anticipated to contribute to the optimization of health care strategies.

The scenario presented refers to collaborative handling in tape-laying for building aerospace composite parts. The tools, models and techniques developed and used to build the beWare of the Robot application are described. System setup and configuration are presented in detail, as well as user tracking and navigation issues. Special emphasis is given to the interaction techniques used to facilitate implementation of virtual humanrobot (HR) collaboration. Safety issues, such as contacts and collisions are mainly tackled through emergencies, i.e. warning signals in terms of visual stimuli and sound alarms. Mental safety is of utmost priority and the user is provided augmented situational awareness and enhanced perception of the robots motion due to immersion and real-time interaction offered by the VRTS as well as by special warning stimuli. The short-term goal of the research was to investigate users enhanced experience and behaviour inside the virtual world while cooperating with the robot and positive pertinent preliminary findings are presented and briefly discussed. In the longer term, the system can be used to investigate acceptability of HR collaboration and, ultimately, serve as a platform for programming collaborative HR manufacturing cells.",NULL,NULL
401,"The effectiveness of asking behaviors among 911 year-old children in increasing home availability and childrens intake of fruit and vegetables: results from the Squires Quest II self-regulation game intervention","Background Home environment has an important influence on childrens fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption, but children may in turn also impact their home FV environment, e.g. by asking for FV. The Squires Quest II serious game intervention aimed to increase asking behaviors to improve home FV availability and childrens FV intake. This studys aims were to assess: 1) did asking behaviors at baseline predict home FV availability at baseline (T0) (RQ1); 2) were asking behaviors and home FV availability influenced by the intervention (RQ2); 3) did increases in asking behaviors predict increased home FV availability (RQ3); and 4) did increases in asking behaviors and increases in home FV availability mediate increases in FV intake among children (RQ4)? Methods This is a secondary analysis of a study using a randomized controlled trial, with 4 groups (each n =100 childparent dyads). All groups were analyzed together for this paper since groups did not vary on components relevant to our analysis. All children and parents ( n =400 dyads) received a self-regulation serious game intervention and parent material. The intervention ran for three months. Measurements were taken at baseline, immediately after intervention and at 3-month follow-up. Asking behavior and home FV availability were measured using questionnaires; child FV intake was measured using 24-h dietary recalls. ANCOVA methods (research question 1), linear mixed-effect models (research question 2), and Structural Equation Modeling (research questions 3 and 4) were used. Results Baseline child asking behaviors predicted baseline home FV availability. The intervention increased child asking behaviors and home FV availability. Increases in child asking behaviors, however, did not predict increased home FV availability. Increased child asking behaviors and home FV availability also did not mediate the increases in child FV intake. Conclusions Children influence their home FV environment through their asking behaviors, which can be enhanced via a serious game intervention. The obtained increases in asking behavior were, however, insufficient to affect home FV availability or intake. Other factors, such as child preferences, sample characteristics, intervention duration and parental direct involvement may play a role and warrant examination in future research.

With the rapid development of HCI techniques, saturated with digital media in their daily lives, young children, demands more interactive learning methods and meaningful immersive learning experiences. In this paper, we propose a novel hand gesture-based puppetry storytelling system which provides a more intuitive and natural human computer interaction method for young children to develop narrative ability in virtual story world. Depth motion sensing and hand gestures control technology is utilized in the implementation of user-friendly interaction. Young players could intuitively use hand gestures to manipulate virtual puppet to perform story and interact with different items in virtual environment to assist narration.

The usability of the system is preliminary examined in our test, and the results which showed that young children can benefit from playing with Puppet Narrator.",NULL,NULL
403,"The Impact of Game-Like Features on Learning from an Intelligent Tutoring System","Prior research has shown that students learn from Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). However, students attention may drift or become disengaged with the task over extended amounts of instruction. To remedy this problem, researchers have examined the impact of game-like features (e.g., a narrative) in digital learning environments on motivation and learning. Some of this research has concluded that the game-like features decrease learning because the features take away resources from the primary task of learning subject-matter content. However, these experiments have involved short-term interventions of less than an hour. Two experiments using college students examined the impact of adding game-like features to the ITS AutoTutor in an intervention that lasted 4h. In one study, a game-like version was compared to a text-only version and a do nothing control. In another study, a game-like version was compared to a nongame version that had similar interfaces. Unlike prior research that has shown that narratives decrease learning in digitally-based learning environments, the game-like features, which included a narrative, had little impact on learning from the ITS. Reasons for the discrepancies are discussed.",NULL,NULL
404,"Visuohaptic augmented feedback for enhancing motor skills acquisition","Serious games are accepted as an effective approach to deliver augmented feedback in motor (re-)learning processes. The multi-modal nature of the conventional computer games (e.g. audiovisual representation) plus the ability to interact via haptic-enabled inputs provides a more immersive experience. Thus, particular disciplines such as medical education in which frequent hands on rehearsals play a key role in learning core motor skills (e.g. physical palpations) may benefit from this technique. Challenges such as the impracticality of verbalising palpation experience by tutors and ethical considerations may prevent the medical students from correctly learning core palpation skills. This work presents a new data glove, built from off-the-shelf components which captures pressure sensitivity designed to provide feedback for palpation tasks. In this work the data glove is used to control a serious game adapted from the infinite runner genre to improve motor skill acquisition. A comparative evaluation on usability and effectiveness of the method using multimodal visualisations, as part of a larger study to enhance pressure sensitivity, is presented. Thirty participants divided into a game-playing group ( $$n=15$$ n = 15 ) and a control group ( $$n=15$$ n = 15 ) were invited to perform a simple palpation task. The game-playing group significantly outperformed the control group in which abstract visualisation of force was provided to the users in a blind-folded transfer test. The game-based training approach was positively described by the game-playing group as enjoyable and engaging.",NULL,NULL
405,"Success factors for serious games to enhance learning: a systematic review","There is no doubt that an abundance of factors exists that makes learning with serious games successful. Research articles reporting on these factors, however, tend to focus on select serious game elements and do not combine all salient factors for successful learning with serious games. Addressing this gap is a necessity for the success of serious games and may even alleviate long-standing debates about pedagogy over enjoyment, how much realism is enough or whether artificial intelligence is worth the cost. This article examines existing academic literature from 2000 to 2015, extracting shared serious game success factors that have had an encouraging impact on gameful learning experiences. As such, we subsequently aim to withdraw the field from a perpetual spiral of does-my-game-work research toward more worthwhile why-does-my-game-not-work research. Qualitative content analysis through the constant comparison method (CCM) analyzed a total of 63 articles from a variety of recognized electronic libraries and databases. Through this analysis, we reveal five central serious game themes: backstory and production; realism; artificial intelligence and adaptivity; interaction; and feedback and debriefing, all of which require deliberate intertwining with pedagogical content to ensure successful learning. This review unravels each of the five themes into their constituent factors and consequently presents the factors as practical guidelines that serious games producers should strive to include in their game productions. Applying these recommendations whenever serious games are considered will provide a foundation for effective gameful learning experiences.",NULL,NULL
406,"Using combinatorial creativity to support end-user design of digital games","To really exploit the full potential of computer games in areas other than entertainment, it will be necessary to reduce the high cost associated with their design and development and to put their production directly into the hands of the domain experts. Although these experts might be interested in integrating games in their activities, they normally do not have the required technical background to create or adapt games to their needs. We propose to tackle the complexity of game design, and thereby facilitate end user design, by defining the games as a combination of more simple games following a combinatorial creativity approach. This approach does not impose the cognitive overload of learning a new design language. In addition, it might also speed up the description of the games insofar as designers do not start from scratch, trying to match their ideas with game components, but they rely upon a set of archetypical games they can combine to reach their goals. The design technique is complemented with a game platform that offers a set of authoring tools for describing game designs that can be exported to XML files, and a game engine able to interpret such files and automatically generate a 3D virtual environment in which the games can be played. In this way, designers can envision games they will be able to design in an iterative way and play the games they design to assess their validity. The proposed combinatorial approach has been evaluated in two focus group experiences that validate its feasibility and acceptability both by technical and non-technical users.",NULL,NULL
407,"The effects of stereoscopic 3D on knowledge retention within a serious gaming environment","We present the results of an experiment that investigated the effects of stereoscopic 3D viewing on knowledge retention with respect to a spatial interactive task within a serious game that was designed for fire safety training. Participants were trained to identify the safe distance to remain from a (virtual) fire in both stereoscopic 3D and non-stereoscopic 3D contexts. After a 24h period, they were then tested to determine whether they retained the information that they were taught. Contrary to prior work that suggests stereoscopic 3D has an impact on knowledge retention, our results indicate no significant difference between knowledge retention in a stereoscopic 3D versus a non-stereoscopic 3D interactive environment. Although greater work remains to be done and no firm conclusions can be made regarding the use of stereoscopic 3D, our results have shown that stereoscopic 3D does not always lead to greater performance. Our results have implications for designers of serious games; the discussion and decision to use stereoscopic 3D should be incorporated early in the design phase and there should be some consideration placed on individualized calibration of stereoscopic 3D settings.",NULL,NULL
408,"Academic methods for usability evaluation of serious games: a systematic review","In the last years, there has been an increasing interest in the design of video games as a tool for education, training, health promotion, socialization, etc. Usability, which is a key factor in any video game, becomes even more important in these so-called serious games, where the users special characteristics should be considered, and the game efficacy depends on the users adherence and engagement. However, evaluation of the usability of this kind of games requires a redefinition of techniques, methods and even terminology. In this paper, we elicit six research questions and conduct a systematic review of the scientific literature, which resulted in the selection of 187 papers that contained the most relevant responses. The conclusions of this systematic review illustrate the general status of current academic usability evaluations of these games and the main trends in the selection of methodologies and how are they applied.

409,"Towards Developing a Therapeutic Serious Game Design Model for Stimulating Cognitive Abilities: A Case for Children with Speech and Language Delay","Recently, serious games aimed at cognitive therapy have been gaining increasing importance in general health applications, creating new possibilities for various groups, including children, to access new forms of treatment. However, to develop therapeutic serious games that stimulate the cognitive abilities of children with speech and language delay (CSLD), the needs of this group and a few other issues must be considered. Therefore, this paper aims to identify the problems affecting the cognitive functions of CSLD as well as their needs, to assist in the development of a serious game for CSLD. We conducted a preliminary study through a semi-structured interview with experts in the area of therapy. Our results indicate that CSLD indeed have major difficulties that affect the development of their cognitive abilities such as memory, attention, perception, problem solving, decision making, language, learning, and reasoning. In addition, CSLD also lack preverbal and motor skills. These findings reinforce the need to propose a model for therapeutic serious game design that stimulates the cognitive abilities of CSLD.",NULL,NULL
410,"Managing Obesity Prevention Using Digital Media: A Double-Sided Approach","In this chapter we report results from a study on a digital health communication campaign initiated by Childrens Healthcare of Atlanta. This campaign has triggered a highly controversial discussion in the USA, because it used obese children and showed them in online media talking about being stigmatized. Our research is based on the assumption that controversial campaigns disseminated via online media run the risk of being re-contextualized, with the possible negative result of jeopardizing the original communicators intentions. Results showed that contextual reinforcement of the campaign message (in three contexts: Facebook, online-news, and a health-related blog) improved the self-relevance-perceptions of adolescent recipients. Also, the participants affective self-perceptions concerning their own weight were significantly influenced by the argumentative reframing of the original message on a Facebook site, a Blog, and an online news site. In addition, we report about the development and evaluation of a motion-controlled serious game used to address barriers of obesity prevention in school aged children. In the media, communication about health-related risks mainly uses fear as a motivation for lifestyle-changes, as the time window to communicate the message is usually very short. In contrast, to support motivation in an informal unguided learning context which has to be viable for a longer time, the gamification of learning content is an important strategy. The focus of the serious game is on (1) self-reflective diagnostic tools to analyse the daily food intake and free-time activities, (2) gamified information and knowledge-tests about food groups, drinks, and energy density, as well as (3) relaxation exercises to aid addressing psychosocial aspects.",NULL,NULL
411,"A Tangible Serious Game Approach to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Education","The chapters idea stems from the observation that technology is difficult to learn in an abstract way (books, lectures, etc.) and practical activities are needed not only to apply concepts but also to help learning itself. This is particularly challenging in a younger age where this concern is often neglected frequently, leading to poor instruction, if any. However, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) topics typically involve facts and concepts that could be effectively implemented and/or shown through smart objects according to the Internet-of-Things paradigm. Such objects, we called iBlocks, could be manipulated by young learners to study various types of phenomena/artifacts and compose new aggregations (reflecting  at a younger age  the experience of the Makers now successful in world-leading technological universities). The presented idea is to build an environment consisting of physical objects enhanced with sensing, computing, and communicating capabilities in order to support advanced and multimodal/multisensory interaction. An important aspect is that the environment supports the definition of game rules, so that users are stimulated and invited in educational paths involving guided exploration, competition, and collaboration.",NULL,NULL
412,"Interactive Kinect-Based Rehabilitation Framework for Assisting Children with Upper Limb Cerebral Palsy","The use of computer games as adjunct to conventional cerebral palsy (CP) rehabilitation provides a promising approach to actively engage CP children in physical therapy exercises. This chapter provides a summary of previous studies that incorporated computer games for CP rehabilitation. Moreover, a comprehensive game-based rehabilitation framework is presented to enable CP children to actively participate in upper-limb physical exercises. The framework design is based on five features that aim to achieve enjoyable and effective game-based physical exercises for complementing conventional CP rehabilitation. A prototype implementation of the framework is developed, which includes three Kinect-based games that target upper-limb excesses. The prototype implementation was employed in the rehabilitation of three CP patients, and the preliminary results suggest the feasibility of the framework for complementary CP rehabilitation. The chapter also discusses some design challenges that are being tackled to continue the development of the comprehensive rehabilitation framework along with proposed solutions.",NULL,NULL
413,"Model for Design of Serious Game for Rehabilitation in Children with Cochlear Implant","This paper presents a model based on Auditory-verbal therapy, which is carried out with deaf children who have benefited from a cochlear implant. These children must learn to acquire listening skills to develop their language. It is the speech therapist who helps the children during the rehabilitation process. A serious game could therefore help in the process of acquiring listening skills, wherein play activities are integrated but have a therapeutic effect. A model is presented here for the design of such a game. This model is based on an analysis of different types of game-therapy-player relationships, to identify the mechanics of the game and reliably build player profiles. All the inquiries are aimed at identifying different aspect between different types of game-therapy-player; to do this, 12 children from the Institute for Deaf and Blind Children, in Cali, Colombia participated, the children ranging from 7 to 11 years of age, all with a cochlear implant, where were analyzed a set of games for PC oriented toward speech therapy. The evaluations were made to identify different aspects like: users, game and pedagogical, in each action undertaken by the child on interact with the game. Finally it recreates a story through the character called Phonak who has become lost in a planet called Sounds and has to learn to listen in order to find his family. In turn, the game will help to develop not only speech and language skills but also cognitive ones. In this light, a serious game was put forward aimed at attracting the childs attention.",NULL,NULL
414,"Promoting Healthy Adolescent Lifestyles Through Serious Games: Enacting a Multidisciplinary Approach","Long-term health risks associated with unhealthy lifestyles present a significant current and future burden for healthcare providers. Adolescence represents a critical time for intervention, as habits formed during this period can persist throughout adult life. Given the prevalence of gaming as an entertainment medium amongst adolescents, and subsequent potential for engagement, the use of serious games to promote changes in lifestyle behaviour offers a potential solution. Creating such games requires a breadth of multidisciplinary expertise, working collaboratively to create research-informed designs which reflect both behavioural theory and entertainment game design best practices. In this chapter, challenges and benefits associated with multidisciplinary design are identified and discussed, with strategies presented to overcome and avoid potential issues. With reference to a current project, the perspectives of the theorist, iterative designer, and game developer are contrasted, providing a reference for future projects implementing multidisciplinary approaches to serious game design.",NULL,NULL
415,"Intelligent Behaviors of Virtual Characters in Serious Games for Child Safety Education","The child safety education is a very urgent task in China. It is necessary to teach children to recognize unsafe factors and learn how to escape from a dangerous situation. According to the psychological characteristics of children and constructivist learning theory, 3D serious game is an effective tool to assist child safety education in primary and secondary schools. In this chapter, we summarized some of our explorations in this field. We proposed a concept of the danger zone to simulate users risk-taking behavior, introduced Non-Player Character (NPC) to increase user engagement, and developed a cognitive model that could simulate the intelligent behavior of virtual agents. We also tested cases of escaping from waterside area and earthquake. Results showed that children enjoyed this new safety educational method. By playing the game, they will learn what a danger zone is and how to escape from the danger zone effectively.",NULL,NULL
416,"ICT-Enabled Emotional Learning for Special Needs Education","Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is a neuro-developmental disability. Children with ASD often find it difficult to express and recognize emotions which make it hard for them to interact socially. Conventional emotional learning for children with ASD often uses medicinal means, and behavioural analysis that could be costly and less effective. There is a significant need to develop Infocomm Technology (ICT) based methods for effective emotional learning. We are interested to develop an iPAD-based game approach for children with ASD to learn emotion through interactive gaming.

417,"Using Serious Games to (Re)Train Cognition in Adolescents","Cognitive training has been studied in the context of many psychological disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, depression, and addiction. While several studies have found clinically relevant training effects, both in preclinical (experimental) and in clinical settings, cognitive training is often experienced as rather boring. Therefore, several studies have recently started to integrate serious gaming techniques into cognitive training paradigms to enhance motivation to train, especially among younger subjects. In this chapter, we discuss the relevant theoretical frameworks supporting both the trainings and the gamification techniques, review several attempts that have been made so far, and discuss the progress that has currently been made. The chapter will end with a number of recommendations, based on published evidence, as well as our own experience in this field.",NULL,NULL

419,"Games for Mental and Moral Development of Youth: A Review of Empirical Studies","This study aims at critically reviewing recently published papers on the use of games for serious purposes to help young peoples mental and moral development. The objective of this review is: (a) to present the empirical evidence of games for serious purposes as an effective vehicle to transfer moral value orientations and positive emotions; (b) to identify the explored area of the game impact and evaluate the effectiveness of a game impact from the previous studies; (c) to summarize different game assessments and study designs of the previous studies; (d) to define future research perspectives. After searching several influential databases, 26 relevant articles were included in the study. This review provided empirical evidences that games for serious purposes may improve young peoples prosocial behaviour, empathy, emotion regulation, mental health and moral belief. Furthermore, these games can change peoples attitude, affect peoples behaviour and even influence peoples psychological state. This review made a comprehensive summary of game assessment including in- and out off-game assessment and detailed analysis of study designs from the previous study. The current finding reveals that studies about prosocial games are of relatively good quality, and that there is great potential for the study of games regarding empathy and moral development. Besides, in accordance with Johnson and Halls Job Demand-Control-Support (JDCS) model, a new and innovative way of classifying games is proposed: purpose-driven, action-driven, mode-driven and game context-driven.",NULL,NULL

421,"Investigating the Design and Evaluation of Educational Games Under the Perspective of Player Experience","Educational games are praised for their potential in providing engaging and self motivating learning experiences. However, in order to fully leverage those capabilities, game designers have to carefully balance factors that provide an enjoyable experience, without losing the focus on the instructional aspect. This work examines the design and evaluation of educational games focusing on the perspective of individual player emotions and experience. This investigation targets the following research questions: how to include (and balance) both the educational and the player experience elements into the game design? Which specific methodologies are available to evaluate player experience in educational games? After discussing possible answers to these questions, we briefly sketch directions that demand further research.",NULL,NULL
422,"End-User Development for Serious Games","End-User Development (EUD) is a topic that finds application in varied domains but so far it has only been marginally considered in digital games research. However, there are several games that would benefit from a EUD approach, in particular for those games designed for a purpose other than entertainment, such as learning or training. These processes are permeated by large individual variation; as a consequence, the teacher must have a control over the game to use it like any other educational resource. In this chapter we present the state of the art in research on EUD for serious games from academic and industrial perspectives. We discuss a case study investigating the design process and evaluation of the Actors Programming Environment (APE), a EUD tool for modelling the behaviour of Non-Player Characters (NPCs). Starting from the literature review and empirical experience gathered over a time span of two years, the chapter provides a set of guidelines for the design of EUD tools for serious games, reflecting on their importance and complexity. It concludes with a set of heuristics that may advance research in the topic.",NULL,NULL

Typically, these games target communication skills, social interaction and speech. There are, however, few SGs for autistic children which have the aim of helping to moderate sensory hypersensitivity. This paper presents an SG which aims to target this area. A set of critical sounds was heuristically determined, and implemented in an interactive SG for reducing auditory hypersensitivity (i.e. over-sensitivity to environmental sounds) in children with ASD. The game, Sinbad and the Magic Cure , is designed for Android devices, and is intended for children aged 811.",NULL,NULL
424,"Improving the Learning of Child Movements Through Games","A Developmental Coordination Disorder can be identified when children show motor skills either below the expected levels considered adequate to their physical age or the opportunities provided for their learning. This problem affects four to six percent of school-age children, meaning that, from a very early stage of their life, they have several difficulties to adapt to the daily needs. In order to reduce the impact caused by this disorder, a team of therapists from  Centro DIFERENAS  Centro de Desenvolvimento Infantil collected a wide range of exercises that allow the stimulus of several motor areas, including both the Gross and Fine Motor Skills. However, the application of this therapeutics is restricted to regular appointments. Since the motor stimulus, in order to be effective, need continuous application, it was found to be necessary to have a tool that in a practical and affordable way, fulfill this need. Therefore, the proposal presented in this article describes the creation of a systematic collection of such exercises in a friendly user manner for the children to be able to exercise elsewhere.",NULL,NULL
425,"Immersion and Narrative Design in Educational Games Across Cultures","Games have great potential as teaching tools, in part due to their immersive, intrinsically motivating narratives which compel players to deeply engage with their worlds. However, little research has been done into how the culture of the player shapes the design and impact of the narrative, and therefore the design of an educational game so it can most effectively teach to particular cultures. To help resolve this issue, several theories of narratives, education, immersion and cultural issues in games were investigated, in order to find the core aspects and common aspects about what can make educational game narratives culturally relevant and immersive. The outcome of this investigation is the INDEC framework, which demonstrates how to structure an educational games design to incorporate cultural issues, in order to identify how engaging a game would be to players across different cultures.",NULL,NULL

427,"Overview of Instructional Techniques to Facilitate Learning and Motivation of Serious Games","Computer games that are used for the purpose of learning, training, and instruction are often referred to as serious games. The last decade shows a huge increase in empirical studies investigating the learning effectiveness and motivational appeal of serious games. Recent meta-analyses show that serious games are effective compared to traditional instruction but that the effectiveness can be improved. This chapter explores which specific instructional techniques can further improve learning and increase motivation. We define instructional techniques as any adaptation of a feature of the game itself or in the context of the game that influences the selection of relevant information, the organization, and integration of that information and/or the intrinsic motivation of the player. The starting point is a meta-analysis conducted in 2013 that is updated and extended. The meta-analysis has a value-added approach and shows which game features can improve learning and/or increase motivation. The interpretation of the results will yield nine proven effective or promising instructional techniques in terms of learning and/or motivation. This set of nine techniquescontent integration, context integration, assessment and adaptivity, level of realism, narration-based techniques, feedback, self-explanation and reflection, collaboration and competition, and modelingform the basis of this volume, which is closed by a reflection chapter.",NULL,NULL

429,"Rising to the Challenge: An Emotion-Driven Approach Toward Adaptive Serious Games","Serious games are steadily becoming a powerful tool for educational purposes as their challenging characteristics are suggested to make them particularly appealing to learn with. This challenging nature, however, comes at a price, namely, the need to maintain the optimal balance according to players emotional experiences. By focusing on players emotions as main player characteristic considered to be important for learning processes and performance, this chapter surveys empirical research and current game development that contributes to an emotion-adaptive framework for games. The goal of this chapter is to clarify the importance of continuously adjusting game characteristics to players emotional states. As the interaction between game characteristics and players emotions highlights the need for continuously assessing at what point gameplay becomes more or less positively or negatively affected, methods for emotion recognition are presented. A summary of adaptable game design elements as well as implementation methods for adaptivity are provided.",NULL,NULL
430,"Supporting Rehabilitation of ADHD Children with Serious Games and Enhancement of Inhibition Mechanisms","The Attention DeficitHyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a behavior-related disorder, already present in children in pre-scholar and scholar age, that mainly includes hyperactivity, lacks in attention skills, impulsivity (delay aversion). While several approaches have been studied and developed for modelling and facing the various aspects of ADHD, the Dual Pathway Model (DPM), by Sonuga-Barke, is an evidence-based model that synthetizes in the cognitive and motivational paths the key dysfunctions, the inhibitory and delay aversion ones. In this paper is presented the development of a prototype of a computer serious game, called Antonyms, based on the DPM model, that is aimed at promoting learning and autonomous management of impulsive behaviors and at inhibiting irrelevant thoughts in children with ADHD. The game is structured as a set of tasks, contextualized in a story, impelling the player to react in an inadequate and immediate way while the player, to win, has to enhance his/her own skills of self-regulation, waiting, reflecting upon a situation, finding a not-intuitive solution. Preliminary tests on a control group show that impulsivity and inattention are really addressed during gameplay.",NULL,NULL

We classified learner groups, learning subjects, and learning environments mentioned in the literature. From this we conclude that AR games for learning generally have positive effects. We found that the most reported effects for AR learning games were the enhancement of learning performance and the learning experience in terms of fun, interest, and enjoyment. The most commonly used measurements for learning achievements were pre-test and post-test regarding knowledge content, while observations, questionnaires, and interviews were all frequently used to determine motivation. We also found that social interactions were encouraged by AR learning games, especially collaboration among students. The most commonly used game elements included quizzes and goal-setting. Extra instructional materials, 3D models, and face-to-face interactions were most frequently used for AR features. In addition, we came up with five suggestions for the design of AR learning games based on reviewed studies. In conclusion, six interesting findings were discussed in detail in the review, and suggestions for future study were offered to fill the research gaps.",NULL,NULL
432,"What Children Really Contribute When Participating in the Design of Web-Based Learning Applications","Over the past 20 years a vast amount of research has been published on participatory design (PD) with children  especially in the field of educational technology design. The literature reveals many advantages (e.g. giving children voice in design), but also some challenges (e.g. overcoming the power distance between co-designers). What is difficult to find in published results on PD with children, is evidence that the childrens design ideas are suitable for development into actual products. Serious educational games (SEGs) have to meet certain requirements. If children participate in the design of SEGs but their designs do not fulfil these requirements, are we still supposed to include them in the final product? Researchers often present examples and descriptions of the prototypes produced by child designers, but they do not always discuss to what extent these ideas are implementable. This paper reports on a study to assess childrens contribution to the design of a web based educational application in the form of a SEG. Using a case study, childrens prototypes were analysed using a valued framework for SEG design to determine if their designs satisfy the requirements of SEGs. The results demonstrate how children naturally include the elements of the SEG design framework. The findings confirm that involving children in the design of a web based educational game using well-tested techniques for doing PD with children, will result in design ideas that are in line with general requirements for SEGs and are thus implementable.",NULL,NULL

436,"An Overview of Serious Game Engines and Frameworks","Despite the growing popularity and widespread use of serious games, the development of effective serious games is difficult, requiring an appropriate balance between game design and instructional design. Although there are fundamental differences between games developed purely for entertainment compared to those developed for serious purposes, there are currently no standard development tools specifically intended for serious game design and development available that encourage developers to follow a set of best practices. Rather, developers of serious games often rely on existing game engines and frameworks that are specific to entertainment-based game development. Given the availability of a large number of game engines and frameworks, deciding on which one to use to develop a serious game may be difficult, yet the choice of engine or framework can play a significant role in the development process. In this paper we present the results of a literature review that examined the frameworks and game engines that are used to develop serious games. We provide a list of the most commonly used frameworks and game engines and summarize their features. Knowledge of the frameworks and game engines that are most popular and details regarding why they are popular may prove to be useful to serious games developers seeking such tools. The chapter ends with a brief discussion regarding a framework that is currently being developed specifically for the development of serious games. Through consultation with the potential users of the framework (serious games developers), the framework aims to strike a balance between ease of use and functionality, while providing the user with the necessary options and tools to ideally develop effective serious games.",NULL,NULL
437,"Factors Associated with Player Satisfaction and Educational Value of Serious Games","Computer games are well-established forms of entertainment which have been shown to promote the development of important cognitive skills. This has also seen their evolution into games supporting training and education, known as serious games. In order to investigate those factors that would be important when developing these types of games, we conducted a 2-year study on undergraduate game development students. Seventy-four students participated in the study. They were asked for their views on three web-based serious games (Cancer Game, Darfur is Dying and Elude). A series of study questionnaires were used to collect data on their playing experience, satisfaction with the games and how well they acquired subject-specific knowledge after playing them. The students views on the games entertainment and educational value were mixed. Two games (Cancer Game and Darfur is Dying) were able to increase players knowledge as a result of playing them but to differing extents. Suggested improvements to the games focused on providing more appropriate background information on the subject within the game and giving the player better feedback on how to play it. When the results were compared to existing heuristics on game development improvements to the design of the game interface, game mechanics and game playability were identified. The need to incorporate learning outcomes into the games and that they be outcome based is also important pedagogical factors. In this initial study, we have suggested a series of heuristics which the authors believe will be important to developers of serious games.",NULL,NULL

440,"Creating Story-Based Serious Games Using a Controlled Natural Language Domain Specific Modeling Language","Creating serious games calls for a multidisciplinary design team, including game developers, subject-matter experts, pedagogical experts, and narrative designers. However, such multidisciplinary teams often experience communication and collaboration problems due to differences in terminology, background and the concerns of the people involved. As one step towards solving this problem, we developed a modeling language for authors of serious games to specify both the story and the pedagogical aspects of a narrative-based (i.e., story-based) serious game. The models created with the help of this language can then be processed in order to automatically generate (parts of) the game. The language is specifically designed to support the involvement of experts with a non-technical background. To achieve this, we employ a domain specific modeling language, i.e., a language specific for the domain of serious games and customizable to the terminology of the domain the serious game is dealing with. Furthermore, the language makes use of a Controlled Natural Language syntax and graphical notations. The combination of a domain specific vocabulary, a natural language syntax, and an easy to understand graphical notation allows different experts to be actively involved in the specification of the serious game, as such increasing consensus and enhancing quality. Furthermore, the model-based approach allows for a shortening of the development time of serious games (and therefore also their cost). As such, the approach tackles one of the major barriers for the development and widespread use of serious games. In this chapter, we present a complete overview of the domain specific modeling language and the associated tools developed to support the model-based approach.",NULL,NULL

We start discussing the current societal challenges including digital ageism, digital access, and interaction (Sawchuk and Lafontaine 2015) among elders and the generation segregation (Thang 2011). We then introduce the activities developed within the Silver Gaming group in the Ageing + Communication + Technologies partnership project ( http://www.actproject.ca ) to advance our understanding of how applied research activities can contribute to the development of participatory game creation and different types of digital games (Romero and Loos 2015). Within the context of the ACT Silver Gaming activities, this chapter explores four instances that used game creation as an intergenerational participation activity. The first activity, held in a secondary school of the Qubec City metropolitan area used making a game to bring together the life narrative of an older adult who had immigrated to Qubec with secondary level students. The second and third occurrences were held during the Silver Gaming International Summer School (SGISS) in August, 2015, reuniting participants starting from secondary level students and adults from different ages groups. The fourth instance was a workshop held in September, 2015, at an intergenerational activity day at La Maison Lon-Provancher , a Qubec city-based organization that is promoting biology, science, and technology to grade-school children and the community, including their parents and grandparents.

445,"How to Use Game Elements to Enhance Learning: Applications of the Theory of Gamified Learning","The theory of gamified learning (Landers RN, Simul Games 45(6):752768. doi:10.1177/1046878114563660, 2014) presents a theoretical model in which game elements, drawn from the serious games literature, are used in isolation or in limited combination to gamify existing instructional processes in order to improve learning. Critically, individual game elements must be linked to specific behavioral, motivational, or attitudinal outcomes, which in turn must be linked to learning outcomes, in order for gamification to be effective. Without establishing such links, gamification may appear to be unsuccessful when implementations have in fact succeeded. In this chapter, we expand upon the theory of gamified learning by providing applied examples of each of the nine major categories of game elements and linking those elements theoretically to the behavioral and attitudinal constructs they are best predicted to affect. In short, we explain how to gamify learning in a scientifically supported fashion. We conclude with recommendations for both research and practice of gamification in learning.",NULL,NULL

Based on the information gap theory of Loewenstein and the cognitive conflict notion of Berlyne we argue that curiosity-triggering events and surprises can have a positive effect on learning. Inserting these events in the game Zeldenrust did indeed show positive learning effects, though the size of effect depends on the preexisting (meta)cognitive abilities of the students.",NULL,NULL
448,"Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment for Serious Game Using Modified Evolutionary Algorithm","Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) seeks to adapt the challenge a game poses to a human player. When the game is too easy the player can become bored, when it is too hard - frustrated. In the case of a serious game (educational game), additionally, without a balance between the player competence and the game challenge the game could repeatedly exploit the developed skills, or fail to achieve the pedagogical goals. In this paper evolutionary algorithm (EA) is used to find game settings suitable for the player of a serious math game. To reduce the number of training data and accelerate the search for the right game difficulty level EA modifications are introduced. Various experiments are performed. The obtained results show that proposed methods can substantially decrease the time a human player has to wait for a suitable game level.",NULL,NULL
449,"Striking a Balance: User-Experience and Performance in Computerized Game-Based Assessment","Game-based assessment (GBA) is a new frontier in the assessment industry. However, as with serious games, it will likely be important to find an optimal balance between making the game fun versus focusing on achieving the educational goals. We created two minigames to assess students knowledge of argumentation skills. We conducted an iterative counter-balanced pre-survey-interaction-post-survey study with 124 students. We discovered that game presentation sequence and game perceptions are related to performance in two games with varying numbers of game features and alignment to educational content. Specifically, understanding how to play the games is related to performance when users start with a familiar environment and move to one with more game features, whereas enjoyment is related to performance when users start with a more gamified experience before moving to a familiar environment.",NULL,NULL
450,"A Conceptual Model for Educational Game Authoring: A Showcase in Math Games","The educational game development is a multidisciplinary software engineering process, where participate instructional and game designers, artists and programmers. Nevertheless, educators, who have an important role in the process, have limitations in authoring games at any moment to adapt them according to key educational aspects such as intended learning outcomes and their metrics, students learning styles, teaching and learning activities and embedded assessment. We propose a conceptual domain model that supports the development process of educational game authoring tools taking into account both educational and game domains. We consider authoring in two domains. In the educational domain, teachers configure/modify either generic activities with any curricular content, or specific learning activities with a concrete one. In the game domain teachers configure/modify game elements and challenges. Finally, we present two educational game authoring tools in the domain of maths supported by the proposed conceptual model.",NULL,NULL

Serious Games have proved to be useful in capturing and invoking peoples attention and emergency management education is also being delivered through games. The paper presents a relief camp game developed using the figures from World Health Organizations (WHO) report on water, sanitation and hygiene guidelines in emergencies. The game play provides player an understanding of the management of relief camps by giving them a supervisory role to design and organize camp areas. It also encourages players to introduce their own ideas in setting up relief camps. The player is competing against evolutionary computation algorithm. The aims are to create awareness about relief camp management strategies and improving the present approaches for better plans via human competitive testing.",NULL,NULL

This work is aimed to test the efficacy of GameTeen System (GT-System), a serious game that teaches ER strategies to regulate joy (VAS scale) and perceived arousal (FAS scale) in a non-clinical sample of adolescents. We conducted a between-participants experiment in which participants (N=63) played a joy induction game, and then an ER game using one of three types of devices (computer, smartphone, and RGB-D camera). Results revealed that GT-System was only effective in increase perceived arousal after the joy induction game and decrease after the ER game. Statistically significant differences were found between devices conditions after the joy induction game (more intense perceived arousal was reported by participants in RGB-D camera). This finding highlights that the type of device could be an important variable in the efficacy of serious game.",NULL,NULL
454,"Sliced Serious Games: Conceptual Approach Towards Environment-Friendly Mobility Behavior","This paper introduces the concept of Sliced Serious Games aiming to improve environment-friendly mobility behavior. The conceptual approach is motivated by two aspects: First, it is proven that Serious Games can help to learn or to change behavior in educational settings or games for health. Second, referring to climate and pollution, there is a strong need for environment-friendly mobility behavior. The basic idea is to combine both aspects and to provide a playful environment to support environment-friendly mobility behavior. Technically, the key challenge tackles the characteristics of intermodal mobility chains when people are moving from A to B with modality changes and short time frames to play. For that, the concept of Sliced Serious Games considers activity recognition to figure out which modalities are used, and makes use of gamification principles to motivate users to change their mobility behavior and to use environment-friendly modalities. Section1 describes the intention of the approach and characterizes the overall research question, i.e. how to use serious games within intermodal mobility chains with changes among modalities and short time frames to play in a train, in a bus, tram, on a bicycle or during a walk. This leads to the concept of Sliced Serious Games being introduced in Sect.2, considering related work and best practice examples. Section3 describes two prototypes for Sliced Serious Games, Smog and Fred. The main results are summarized in Sect.4, also providing an outlook for future research.",NULL,NULL

The aim of this paper is to propose a serious game model supported by mobile computing for improving learning of specific topics regarding AVC (Adaptive Virtual Courses). The model incorporates three main modules: the web-based backend, the mobile application (game) and finally, the instructional design module in charge of the game content management. The implementation of the model was achieved through the development of EOLo, a functional prototype which was validated using a case study applied to a secondary school English course. The results show that students are motivated with the use of EOLo thanks to the healthy competition offered by the game during the development of learning activities. In addition, the system allows the detection of learning failures and from these generates a proactive feedback based on the recommendation of educational resources.",NULL,NULL
456,"The Gamification of Cybersecurity Training","Due to the rapidly and continued evolving nature of technology, there is a constant need to update police officers training in cyber security to ensure that the UK continues to be a secure place to live and do business. Rather than deliver traditional classroom-based training, our project assesses the effectiveness of the delivery of cyber security through the use of games based learning to simulate cybercrimes and provide training in incident response. The aim of our research is to transform the delivery of first responder training in tackling cybercrime. Through the use of a Game Jam and subsequent prototype development, we have trialed training materials that are based on serious games technology. The game poses a common incident reported to the police, for example the problem of a virtual person receiving offensive messages via Facebook and the training reflects the dialogue with that person and the technical steps to ensure that a copy of the evidence has been preserved for further investigation. Evaluation has been conducted with local police officers. Overall, this approach to the large-scale provision of training (potentially to a whole force) is shown to offer potential.",NULL,NULL

Though some interventions have incorporated elements of gamification and narrative, interactive fiction is a novel approach to educating medical trainees. Diagnosis and management of child abuse requires competencies in patient care, systems-based practice, communication, and professionalism. This complexity, along with the emotional significance of caring for abused children, makes child abuse pediatrics an ideal topic for an initial implementation of an interactive-fiction-based learning module. This module will be compared to a standard e-learning module in the education of physicians training to become pediatricians.",NULL,NULL

With this increasing adoption of SG, designing novel techniques for learners assessment and evaluation has become of paramount importance to improve learning results and thus to maintain players motivation. This paper focuses on the learners assessment and evaluation in SG. After defining assessment and evaluation, we distinguish two main approaches: implicit and explicit. For each of these approaches, we present some techniques currently used in some existing games. Then we compare these different approaches and techniques. This synthesis is expected to help researchers and games creators working in this area and identifying benefits and limitations of these techniques in order to develop a new comprehensive technique that outperforms all existing ones.",NULL,NULL

In such gamified environments, players use technology to solve environmental problems including greener environment, optimised energy and water infrastructure, sustainable resources and reduced energy use. Social Mpower game is a representation of an autonomous energy community for local power generation and distribution in which the participants have to avoid a collective blackout by individually reducing their energy consumption by synchronising and coordinating their actions. Our experimental hypothesis is that collective awareness can be enhanced by appropriate features of the game interface, and therefore to increase the opportunities and prospects for successful collective action (e.g to avoid a blackout).",NULL,NULL
460,"Immersive Games and Expert-Novice Differences","Immersive game-based training has been used effectively for years to train within numerous domains. Immersive simulations and games, however, are frequently used to train at the pinnacle of instruction, though research shows that game- and simulation-based training platforms are consistently more effective than traditional training across all phases of instruction. Game-based training has potentially limitless variables on which training can be adapted: troops can change efficacy, weather can turn and equipment can malfunction. Understanding the relationships between adaptive variables is key to effective game design that distinguishes expert and novice performers for assessment. This paper describes the development of a simulation-based game using distributed concept maps for expertise categorization. The expert models were incorporated into a real-time strategy game intended for use to train and assess understanding of and adherence to Army doctrine. Preliminary validation data are also presented comparing the game to traditional Interactive Multimedia Instruction (IMI) courseware.",NULL,NULL

However, programming novices face many challenges when learning programming theory and syntax, showing the highest failure rates at university level. This study proposes a new syntax-based serious game solution which teaches programming novices C-Style syntax and programming theory. It aims to provide an alternative to block-based programming environment tools like Scratch and aims to better understand how novice programmers learn best today. The proposed solution focuses on two key areas which have shown the most promising results: motivation and syntax. The solution also focuses on reinforcing good programming practices to provide the novice with guidance to transition them to computer programming. The results show that the proposed application users saw an increase of 62.5% in their programming test results in comparison to 34.17% in Scratch users. Overall, the participants using the proposed tool were more positive about their experience, describing it as very fun and a very good educational experience!. Results suggested that participants were not intimidated by the syntax where 9 out of 10 participants have said that they feel more comfortable about programming in the future. Not only that, but encouragingly, novices wanted the proposed application to be more complex challenging the perceptions novices have about programming. Overall, the results support the hypothesis that the proposed syntax-based application is a more motivational and effective tool in transitioning novices to computer programming.",NULL,NULL

For many design students, the principles of participatory design in the creation of new user experiences are part of their curriculum. However, the involvement of disabled persons into the user experience design (UXD) process can be difficult in an educational setting. Often persons with autism and cognitive disabilities are excluded from user experience data collection due to their lack of sufficient cognitive ability and language skills to participate in these research methods in meaningful ways. Further, educators may shy away from involving this group due to institutional regulations and ethical concerns. This paper presents a case study introducing design students to inclusive UXD strategies and observing autistic children, using an approach called the Connectivity Model. The model avoids the requirement for complex ethical clearance by facilitating observations via recorded videos.

In multiple situations, auditory feedbacks can be used to supplement or to reinforce the visual channel, as the auditory channel helps at monitoring the surrounding beyond the limited field of view: over 360. In past studies, we have observed that the ability to properly assess the direction of a 3D sound varies greatly from one person to another. In particular, we found that training plays a major role in this task. To allow people to improve their abilities in perceiving the direction of a 3D virtual sound, we described here a serious that targets this learning.

Integration in the world of sport is one of the solutions that individuals with disabilities or motor disorders develop to feel more socially integrated, more independent and confident with themselves. Boccia is a Paralympic sport that is increasingly getting more attention around the world. This has contributed for the objectives of this project since it attracts these patients a lot more easily and including it in the Serious Games category enables them to develop and rehabilitate their cognitive capabilities.

VR Serious Games are being used as a new tool for both assessment, stimulation and rehabilitation of such impaired functions. Even though the results of these novel applications seem to be promising, some of the assessments based in these solutions use indirect measures to evaluate attentional and mnesic performance (e.g. number of errors, task completion time). Gaze tracking (GT) can provide more accurate and direct indicators of these cognitive processes. On a sample of 46 non-clinical participants (33 Female; 71.7%), with an age average of 27.96 years old (SD=11.92), ocular movements were recorded in two different comparative visual search tasks (CVSTs) that are an integrant part of the cognitive assessment protocol of the Systemic Lisbon Battery (SLB). Number of visits and total fixations differed based on the assessment with the Mini-mental state examination test (MMSE).

We can exercise students by setting challenges, and asking them to evaluate their work, for novelty and quality. This is to help them to develop and become familiar with their own creative processes; but also to appreciate the different styles of creative thinking that others can have, the properties that society generally values in creative design, and how their own work may be appreciated. In order to achieve this in higher education, it is useful to develop frameworks in which student work can be assessed for creativity in particular, and to offer ways in which work can be assigned to students so that they may produce design concepts and then peer-assess them for their mutual benefit. In this paper we summarise how creativity is evaluated or measured by psychologists and educationalists, as well as more recent proposals by researchers in the new field of computational creativity. We consider how these notions may be applied in the classroom context, to evaluate the creativity of student work. The suggestions are illustrated with our recent assignments to students to produce and assess creative design concepts for serious games.

487,"Flow Theory and Leisure","Csikszentmihalyis flow theory has done more than most to illuminate the study of the leisure experience, providing valuable insights into how the activities of everyday life come to be invested with meaning and experienced as enjoyable. A substantial bank of empirical evidence exists suggesting that flow is certainly something real for people in their leisure. This chapter seeks to draw to the fore the relevance and implications of recent theoretical extensions of flow theory in leisure and their capacity to reflect, and in some cases enrich, human experience in the context of peoples everyday lives.",NULL,NULL
488,"What Do We Get from Leisure? Its Costs","The costs that come with leisure activities are covered first. Next, those costs are examined for their fit in the common sense imagery of leisure as well as in the scientific theory and research that strives to explain it. These leisure costs, conceived of here as either situational or inherent, have been identified as tensions, dislikes, and disappointments. They are examined as they are experienced in serious, casual, and project-based leisure. Selfishness in leisure can be a cost, though it is not part of leisures negative common sense image. Moreover, the victims of selfishness associated with a free-time activity know intimately the effects of this attitude, even while they seem to share the common sense image of leisure held by the general public.",NULL,NULL
489,"A Serious Games Platform for Cognitive Rehabilitation with Preliminary Evaluation","In recent years Serious Games have evolved substantially, solving problems in diverse areas. In particular, in Cognitive Rehabilitation, Serious Games assume a relevant role. Traditional cognitive therapies are often considered repetitive and discouraging for patients and Serious Games can be used to create more dynamic rehabilitation processes, holding patients attention throughout the process and motivating them during their road to recovery. This paper reviews Serious Games and user interfaces in rehabilitation area and details a Serious Games platform for Cognitive Rehabilitation that includes a set of features such as: natural and multimodal user interfaces and social features (competition, collaboration, and handicapping) which can contribute to augment the motivation of patients during the rehabilitation process. The web platform was tested with healthy subjects. Results of this preliminary evaluation show the motivation and the interest of the participants by playing the games.",NULL,NULL
490,"Pre-Service Teacher Training on Game-Enhanced Mathematics Teaching and Learning","The paper reports the main insights from a study aimed at equipping a group of pre-service teachers with the knowledge, skills, and practical experience required to effectively integrate educational games within the mathematics curriculum. An instructional intervention based on the Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge framework was implemented in an undergraduate mathematics methods course attended by thirteen (n=13) prospective primary teachers. Participants experimented with different ways in which educational games could help students internalize key mathematical concepts across the primary curriculum, and were familiarized with the design principles for constructivist gaming environments. Upon completion of a unit on game-enhanced learning, they worked in small groups to develop and deliver, during their teaching placements, instructional episodes integrating the use of serious games. Findings indicate a positive impact on pre-service teachers perceptions regarding game-based learning, and on their competence in selecting, evaluating, and productively utilizing digital games as an instructional tool.",NULL,NULL
491,"Investigating Flow Experience and Scientific Practices During a Mobile Serious Educational Game","Mobile serious educational games (SEGs) show promise for promoting scientific practices and high engagement. Researchers have quantified this engagement according to flow theory. This study investigated whether a mobile SEG promotes flow experience and scientific practices with eighth-grade urban students. Students playing the game ( n =59) were compared with students in a business-as-usual control activity ( n =120). In both scenarios, students worked in small teams. Data measures included an open-ended instrument designed to measure scientific practices, a self-report flow survey, and classroom observations. The game players had significantly higher levels of flow and scientific practices compared to the control group. Observations revealed that game teams received less whole-class instruction and review compared to the control teams. Game teachers had primarily a guide-on-the-side role when facilitating the game, while control teachers predominantly used didactic instruction when facilitating the control activity. Implications for these findings are discussed.",NULL,NULL
492,"Keeping it Real: Creating and Acquiring Assets for Serious Games","This paper presents the data collection methodology for a project aimed at creating a virtual game like experience of a historically significant location in Western Australia. The goal is less about just conveying a sense of the place but more about creating an accurate representation. Where data such as imagery and 3D models are used to represent features at the location are unavailable or approximate, they remain missing rather than filling with interpretations or interpolations. The resulting virtual environment is closer to an archeological recording or database rather than simply a 3D environment one can navigate through and experience. It is proposed that the resulting virtual environment takes on an additional believability and appears more real than if it was enhanced by arbitrary modeling and generic texturing. Presented are the data capture methods employed, the limitations encountered in conducting data capture in the field, constraints imposed by current technology and finally the remaining challenges in the various technologies employed.",NULL,NULL
493,"It's All in the Game: A 3D Learning Model for Business Ethics","How can we improve business ethics education for the twenty first century? This study evaluates the effectiveness of a visual case exercise in the form of a 3D immersive game given to undergraduate students at two UK Universities as part of a mandatory business ethics module. We propose that due to evolving learning styles, the immersive nature of interactive games lends itself as a vehicle to make the learning of ethics more concrete and personal and therefore more engaging. To achieve this, we designed and built an immersive 3D simulation game in the style of a visual case. The effectiveness of the game was evaluated using a mixed methods approach measuring recognised and adapted constructs from the technology acceptance model. Results demonstrate that students found the game beneficial to their learning of ethics with the development of knowledge and skills applicable to the real world and that they engaged with the process due to game elements. Findings demonstrate the potential for the development of simulated games to teach ethics at all levels and modes of delivery and the contribution of this type of visual case model as a pedagogic method.",NULL,NULL
494,"A qualitative study of how people with severe mental illness experience living in sheltered housing with a private fully equipped apartment","Background There are a number of supported housing options for people with severe mental illness (SMI), but limited knowledge about residents experiences. The aim of this study was to explore how people with SMI experienced sheltered housing consisting of both a private fully equipped apartment and a shared accommodation room for socializing. Methods Fourteen people with SMI living in sheltered housing apartments participated in a qualitative study with semi-structured face to face individual or group interviews. Results Residents access to the service providers in the sheltered housing, who were seen as both ordinary people and skilled to observe symptom changes at an early stage, were major factors for the perception of security. In addition, residents highlighted the possibility of living in a fully equipped apartment, and having access to a shared accommodation room to connect with other residents. Having a fully equipped apartment including their own equipment such as a washing machine was said to help reduce conflicts. Short tenancy agreements made some informants feel insecure. It was also essential to have meaningful daily activities outside the residence to avoid re-hospitalization. Conclusions The positive experience was connected to having a fully private equipped apartment including shared accommodation room. The service providers should be aware of the dilemma with in-house support, to make residents feel secure versus increased dependency on service providers.",NULL,NULL
495,"The influence of memory on indoor environment exploration: A numerical study","Understanding human behavior in the context of exploration and navigation is an important but challenging problem. Such understanding can help in the design of safe structures and spaces that implicitly aid humans during evacuation or other emergency situations. In particular, the role that memory plays in this process is something that is crucial to understand. In this paper, we develop a novel serious game-based experimental approach to understanding the non-randomness and the impact of memory on the human exploration process. We show that a simple memory model, with a depth of between 6 and 8 steps, is sufficient to approximate a human-like level of exploration efficiency. We also demonstrate the advantages that a game-based experimental methodology brings to these kinds of experiments in the amount of data that can be collected as compared to traditional experiments. We feel that these findings have important implications for safety-by-design in complex infrastructural structures.",NULL,NULL
496,"The use of games to help children eyes testing","A doctor cannot perform a good diagnosis without the patient collaboration. One of the major problem for ophthalmologists with children is to capture and maintain their attention while performing their tests. Sometimes children give wrong answers, or not accurate, since they are no longer interested in the task. In this paper we use the serious game paradigm to help children eyes testing. We ask the children to perform a vision acuity and a daltonism test using our game PlayWithEyes . Children have to recognize symbols projected on a wall and point them in a touch interface which displays all the possible answers. Tests performed in a kindergarten with 65 children have shown that the use of our game helps to obtain children cooperation because they have fun, so their attention may last longer, thus improving the possibility to perform a correct diagnosis especially for very young children. This is particular important for some sight defects like amblyopia (lazy eye). Moreover, the system allows us to identify visual acuity reduction in two children. Tests also highlight some limitations of the tool which have been promptly fixed.",NULL,NULL
497,"Single-session gamified virtual reality exposure therapy for spider phobia vs. traditional exposure therapy: study protocol for a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial","Background Traditional one-session exposure therapy (OST) in which a patient is gradually exposed to feared stimuli for up to 3h in a one-session format has been found effective for the treatment of specific phobias. However, many individuals with specific phobia are reluctant to seek help, and access to care is lacking due to logistic challenges of accessing, collecting, storing, and/or maintaining stimuli. Virtual reality (VR) exposure therapy may improve upon existing techniques by facilitating access, decreasing cost, and increasing acceptability and effectiveness. The aim of this study is to compare traditional OST with in vivo spiders and a human therapist with a newly developed single-session gamified VR exposure therapy application with modern VR hardware, virtual spiders, and a virtual therapist. Methods/design Participants with specific phobia to spiders ( N =100) will be recruited from the general public, screened, and randomized to either VR exposure therapy ( n =50) or traditional OST ( n =50). A behavioral approach test using in vivo spiders will serve as the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures will include spider phobia questionnaires and self-reported anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Outcomes will be assessed using a non-inferiority design at baseline and at 1, 12, and 52weeks after treatment. Discussion VR exposure therapy has previously been evaluated as a treatment for specific phobias, but there has been a lack of high-quality randomized controlled trials. A new generation of modern, consumer-ready VR devices is being released that are advancing existing technology and have the potential to improve clinical availability and treatment effectiveness. The VR medium is also particularly suitable for taking advantage of recent phobia treatment research emphasizing engagement and new learning, as opposed to physiological habituation. This study compares a market-ready, gamified VR spider phobia exposure application, delivered using consumer VR hardware, with the current gold standard treatment. Implications are discussed.

498,"Casual Games and Casual Learning About Human Biological Systems","Casual games are everywhere. People play them throughout life to pass the time, to engage in social interactions, and to learn. However, their simplicity and use in distraction-heavy environments can attenuate their potential for learning. This experimental study explored the effects playing an online, casual game has on awareness of human biological systems. Two hundred and forty-two children were given pretests at a Museum and posttests at home after playing either a treatment or control game. Also, 41 children were interviewed to explore deeper meanings behind the test results. Results show modest improvement in scientific attitudes, ability to identify human biological systems and in the childrens ability to describe how those systems work together in real-world scenarios. Interviews reveal that children drew upon their prior school learning as they played the game. Also, on the surface they perceived the game as mainly entertainment but were easily able to discern learning outcomes when prompted. Implications for the design of casual games and how they can be used to enhance transfer of knowledge from the classroom to everyday life are discussed.",NULL,NULL
499,"Examination of the Effects of Dimensionality on Cognitive Processing in Science: A Computational Modeling Experiment Comparing Online Laboratory Simulations and Serious Educational Games","Within the last 10years, new tools for assisting in the teaching and learning of academic skills and content within the context of science have arisen. These new tools include multiple types of computer software and hardware to include (video) games. The purpose of this study was to examine and compare the effect of computer learning games in the form of three-dimensional serious educational games, two-dimensional online laboratories, and traditional lecture-based instruction in the context of student content learning in science. In particular, this study examines the impact of dimensionality, or the ability to move along the X- , Y- , and Z -axis in the games. Study subjects ( N =551) were randomly selected using a stratified sampling technique. Independent strata subsamples were developed based upon the conditions of serious educational games, online laboratories, and lecture. The study also computationally models a potential mechanism of action and compares two- and three-dimensional learning environments. F test results suggest a significant difference for the main effect of condition across the factor of content gain score with large effect. Overall, comparisons using computational models suggest that three-dimensional serious educational games increase the level of success in learning as measured with content examinations through greater recruitment and attributional retraining of cognitive systems. The study supports assertions in the literature that the use of games in higher dimensions (i.e., three-dimensional versus two-dimensional) helps to increase student understanding of science concepts.",NULL,NULL
500,"A Brief History of Serious Games","Serious Games are now an established field of study. In this field most would attribute the rise of Serious Games to Clark C Abts creation of the term in 1970, or indeed Ben Sawyers popularization of it in 2002. However, considering the rich history of purposing non-digital games, itself preceded by discussions of purposing play that are traceable to the work of Plato, it can be said that Serious Games is a contemporary manifestation of centuries old theories and practices. In this chapter, we explore the pre-history of Serious Games, beginning with the suggested purpose, and purposing of play.

As a researcher it is critical to recognize that academic research of serious games does not occur in a vaccum. Direct partnerships between universities and commercial organizations are increasingly common, as well as between research institutes and the contexts that their serious games are deployed in. Commercial production of serious games and their increased adoption in non-commercial contexts will influence academic research through emerging impact pathways and funding opportunities. Adding further complexity is the emergence of commercial organizations that undertake their own research, and research institutes that have in-house commercial arms. To conclude, we explore how these issues affect the individual researcher, and offer considerations for future academic and industry serious games projects.",NULL,NULL

In total 25 children from a UK primary school aged between 89 participated in two design sessions. The first session was designed to inform the children about life in rural China. The second session briefly taught the children about aspects of food hygiene and then required them to design a game on this subject, for children in rural China. The outputs from the children were analysed and although all the children managed to design a game, only 6 related this at all to food hygiene, with three of these having only a single element of food hygiene present. The other 19 created games were unrelated to food hygiene. In addition, only 1 drawing showed any evidence of thinking about the target users.

Average human life expectancy has never been as long as it is today and medical advances have greatly improved overall population health. However, modern societies are burdened by new complications in the form of lifestyle diseases which arise due to various aspects of modern life, such as sedentary behavior. The pressure on public health systems is ever increasing with the emergence of further complex and expensive treatment options, and due to the complications resulting from demographic change. The technological advancements of the industrial and information age, the computational revolution in general, and video games for entertainment specifically contribute to the prevalence of some prevalent lifestyle-related health issues. At the same time, computing devices and interactive applications also play an important role in improving all areas of individual and public health. Recent research and early commercial releases deliver convincing evidence that playful applications and games for health in particular offer approaches that can help overcome the motivational barriers which often restrain successful health treatments or preventive actions and behavior. This chapter provides an overview of the arguments that motivate the application of play and game techniques for personal and public health.

510,"Cyberage and Child Mental Health","Most people will have no qualms about visiting a hospital for medical attention for a physical ailment but may have concerns about visiting a hospital for mental health issues. The stigma in mental health is prevalent despite improved healthcare services and efforts to educate the public. Due to the prevalence of mental health disorders, they should be targeted by population-based interventions. In Singapore, a national program was developed to address mental health issues by working across the health and education sectors. This was done using a community team called Response, Early Assessment and Intervention in Community Mental Health (REACH), which was regionally deployed. REACH provided early identification of emotional and behavioral difficulties through assessment, intervention, and training to school counselors and relevant community agencies. Leveraging on the network that REACH developed, technology has created novel and exciting alternative approaches to traditional heathcare delivery models. Serious games, a classification of video games with objectives other than entertainment, such as learning and performing desirable behaviors and skills have been increasingly explored. Recent studies have shown some of the benefits of serious games and their abilities for building positive therapeutic relationships. Essentially, game technology holds potential promise in delivering skills and knowledge to children using interactive features, simulations, and immersive environments. This means that the power of treatment can be readily accessed through downloading applications onto any mobile device. Efforts to modify traditional face-to-face psychological interventions by leveraging on game-based environments can enhance existing mental health services.",NULL,NULL

It has been found to promote learning in a fun and interesting environment. Edutainment applications covered several fields including language learning. However, applications that focused on reading in language learning suffered from some limitations. These limitations include low interactivity and the lack of users reading assessment. In this paper, we will introduce iPlayAStory; an interactive online educational platform for language learning. iPlayAStory provides children with an entertaining application where they can read sentences aloud. The system then assesses the correctness of the childrens reading. Children are provided with feedback and can listen to the correct pronunciation. Moreover, iPlayAStory provides parents and teachers with a clear profile for their childrens performance on the application. Parents and teachers could also record stories with their voice to be played back for their children. iPlayAStory also serves as a platform for speech acquisition. The collected speech data could later be used to build an Automatic Speech Recognition system for detailed assessment of childrens pronunciation.",NULL,NULL
512,"Exploring Emotion Representation to Support Dialogue in Police Training on Child Interviewing","Police officers when dealing with interviewing children have to cope with a complex set of emotions from a vulnerable witness. Triggers for recognising those emotions and how to build rapport are often the basis of learning exercises. However, current training pulls together the full complexity of emotions during role-playing which can be over-whelming and reduce appropriate learning focus. Interestingly a serious games interface can provide valuable training not because it represents full complex, multimedia interactions but because it can restrict emotional complexity and increase focus during the interactions on key factors for emotional recognition. The focus of this paper is to report on a specific aspect that was explored during the development of a serious game that aims to address the current police-training needs of child interviewing techniques, where the recognition of emotions plays an important role in understanding how to build rapport with children. The review of literature reveals that emotion recognition, through facial expressions, can contribute significantly to the perceived quality of communication. For this study an emotions map was created and tested by 41 participants to be used in the development of a targeted interface design to support the different levels of emotion recognition. The emotions identified were validated with a 70% agreement across experts and non-experts highlighting the innate role of emotion recognition. A discussion is made around the role of emotions and game-based systems to support their identification for work-based training. As part of the graphical development of the Child Interview Stimulator (CIS) we examined different levels of emotional recognition that can be used to support the in-game graphical representation of a childs response during a police interview.",NULL,NULL

516,"Game Learning Analytics: Learning Analytics for Serious Games","Video games have become one of the largest entertainment industries, and their power to capture the attention of players worldwide soon prompted the idea of using games to improve education. However, these educational games, commonly referred to as serious games, face different challenges when brought into the classroom, ranging from pragmatic issues (e.g., a high development cost) to deeper educational issues, including a lack of understanding of how the students interact with the games and how the learning process actually occurs. This chapter explores the potential of data-driven approaches to improve the practical applicability of serious games. Existing work done by the entertainment and learning industries helps to build a conceptual model of the tasks required to analyze player interactions in serious games (game learning analytics or GLA). The chapter also describes the main ongoing initiatives to create reference GLA infrastructures and their connection to new emerging specifications from the educational technology field. Finally, it explores how this data-driven GLA will help in the development of a new generation of more effective educational games and new business models that will support their expansion.

The latter focuses on teaching children aged 710 the importance of understanding the benefits of cooperation as well as expressing trustworthiness. Gamification of Prosocial Theory has led to several game mechanics being redefined, in order to turn traditional games elements of competition into cooperation evaluation mechanisms. Using these mechanisms, children are called upon to adapt their gameplay behavior towards expressing prosociality and understanding each others needs. Our experiments solidify this concept, by showcasing promising indications on the games potential to help children understand when it is a good idea to adopt a prosocial behavior.",NULL,NULL

519,"Modeling Games for Adaptive and Personalized Learning","The potential of the adaptive games in the education is yet to be explored. This type of artifacts can increase the multiple benefits reported by the integration of digital games in educational processes, by adding up the advantages of delivering an experience tailored to the individual requirements of the learner. Unfortunately, the adoption of adaptive educational games in the practice is limited due to the difficulty of their implementation, which usually requires the application of techniques and skills related to several areas as pedagogy, game design, adaptive instructional systems, and artificial intelligence. Due to this difficulty, it is essential to carefully examine and evaluate the adaptation approach that best suits each educational process in order to ensure the efficacy of the personalization mechanism to implement. In this work, we present a conceptual model of adaptive educational games that supports this process of reflection and analysis required at the game design stage. The model supports the description of flexible game designs that can accommodate a wide range of adaptations and provides an abstraction layer over the technical details that allows its use by non-expert game designers like educators.",NULL,NULL

527,"Introducing the Fling An Innovative Serious Game to Train Behavioral Control in Adolescents: Protocol of a Randomized Controlled Trial","Behavioral control weaknesses are a strong predictor of problematic behaviors in adolescents, such as heavy alcohol use. Heavy alcohol use at this young age can lead to health and school-related problems and is a severe societal problem. Strengthening of cognitive control mechanisms through computerized training has been shown to have positive effects on behavior, but is often perceived as a tedious exercise. Applying novel serious gaming techniques to evidence-based training paradigms may offer a solution to this motivational problem. This paper describes the design and analysis plan that will be used to evaluate an innovative Serious Game called The Fling, aimed specifically at increasing cognitive control over impulses in adolescents. The game will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) among adolescents between 1518 years in mainstream and special education.",NULL,NULL
528,"Using Mobile-Based Games as a Means for the Self-treatment of Depression and Anxiety in Youth","Long term cases of mental health conditions in Australians generally manifest before the age of 14 years old. Due to this statistic it is important to design cost effective approaches to allow young people the opportunity to self-treat the symptoms of their depression or anxiety. Furthermore, this paper aims to determine if providing these solutions in an age appropriate medium, through serious games on a mobile device, enhances the effectiveness of their treatment. A pilot study was performed to determine if playing serious games on a tablet device improved general mood and decreased heart rate in young Australians.",NULL,NULL

531,"Virtual Reality for Sensorimotor Rehabilitation Post Stroke: Design Principles and Evidence","In the recent years, the use of virtual reality (VR) to enhance motor skills of persons with activity and participation restriction due to disease or injury has been become an important area of research. In this chapter, we describe the design of such VR systems and their underlying principles, such as experience-dependent neuroplasticity and motor learning. Further, psychological constructs related to motivation including salience, goal setting, and rewards are commonly utilized in VR to optimize motivation during rehabilitation activities. Hence, virtually simulated activities are considered to be ideal for (1) the delivery of specific feedback, (2) the ability to perform large volumes of training, and (3) the presentation of precisely calibrated difficulty levels, which maintain a high level of challenge throughout long training sessions. These underlying principles are contrasted with a growing body of research comparing the efficacy of VR with traditionally presented rehabilitation activities in persons with stroke that demonstrate comparable or better outcomes for VR. In addition, a small body of literature has utilized direct assays of neuroplasticity to evaluate the effects of virtual rehabilitation interventions in persons with stroke. Promising developments and findings also arise from the use of off-the-shelf video game systems for virtual rehabilitation purposes and the integration of VR with robots and brain-computer interfaces. Several challenges limiting the translation of virtual rehabilitation into routine rehabilitation practice need to be addressed but the field continues to hold promise to answer key issues faced by modern healthcare.",NULL,NULL
532,"Rhythmic Entrainment in Games","This exploratory paper focuses on the rhythm of game interactions and the rhythmic experience of the player. The players experience of a rhythm involves patterns of attention that are formed through processes of entrainment and habituation. The players body both opens to a rhythm and is influenced by it. There are voluntary and involuntary, conscious and unconscious aspects to these processes and this paper explores the characteristics of these rhythmic dynamics within game experience. In discussing the range and complexity of the processes of rhythmic entrainment, the paper also suggests that this perspective might be useful for the design and analysis of serious games.",NULL,NULL
533,"RAGE Reusable Game Software Components and Their Integration into Serious Game Engines","This paper presents and validates a methodology for integrating reusable software components in diverse game engines. While conforming to the RAGE component-based architecture described elsewhere, the paper explains how the interactions and data exchange processes between a reusable software component and a game engine should be implemented for procuring seamless integration. To this end, a RAGE-compliant C# software component providing a difficulty adaptation routine was integrated with an exemplary strategic tile-based game TileZero. Implementations in MonoGame, Unity and Xamarin, respectively, have demonstrated successful portability of the adaptation component. Also, portability across various delivery platforms (Windows desktop, iOS, Android, Windows Phone) was established. Thereby this study has established the validity of the RAGE architecture and its underlying interaction processes for the cross-platform and cross-game engine reuse of software components. The RAGE architecture thereby accommodates the large scale development and application of reusable software components for serious gaming.",NULL,NULL
534,"Mindtraining: Playful Interaction Techniques for People with Dementia","The paper presents the preliminary studies regarding applicable interaction techniques in the field of tablet games for dementia. Serious games in the dementia context are a well-researched topic. However, there is very little knowledge about performing gestures and interactions on tablet computers by users suffering from dementia. Since they already encounter many restrictions, a touch interface might be another obstacle. Tablet games often require a different kind of interaction, such as single tap, swipe, or drag and drop. We developed the Android application Mindtraining for dementia patients, which integrates multiple interaction techniques. The purpose of the tablet game is to facilitate an intuitive and efficient usage of gestures for people with early- and middle-stage dementia aged over 65 years. In our study we will investigate how people with dementia perform different gestures and how much help they need each time they use the application.",NULL,NULL
535,"A Web Platform of Serious Games for Cognitive Rehabilitation: Architecture and Usability Study","In recent years Serious Games have gained a new importance, very driven by the proliferation of video games and its application in diverse areas. Cognitive rehabilitation is a major area where Serious Games can assume a relevant role. Traditional cognitive therapies quickly become repetitive and discouraging for patients. To mitigate these problems, Serious Games based tools are necessary to create more dynamic rehabilitation processes, holding the attention of the patients throughout the process and motivating them during their road to recovery. This paper describes a web platform for Serious Games in cognitive rehabilitation that integrates a set of features that include natural and multimodal user interfaces and social features (collaboration, competition and handicapping) which can be used to augment the motivation of patients during the rehabilitation process. Results observed in a study with healthy subjects indicate that the platform offers good usability.",NULL,NULL

These games integrate virtual worlds persistence and immersion devices allowing the learners to experience more authentic and rich situations. Several studies highlighted their pedagogical value, knowledge transfer and learners engaged-behaviors. In this paper, we draw the characteristics of these learning games based on the integration of new technologies according to two characteristics: immersion and persistence. To investigate the impact of such technological components, we developed a game and evaluated it in ecological conditions. Four groups of fifteen high school students played the game through two testing conditions: two groups used a prototype allowing only classical interactions limited on usual devices, while the two other groups used a prototype integrating persistent and immersive interactions using Oculus Rift vision. All the interactions were recorded and their analysis suggests more engaged behaviors from students using the immersive and persistent prototype.",NULL,NULL
538,"Heuristic Evaluation for Serious Immersive Games and M-instruction","Two fast growing areas for technology-enhanced learning are serious games and mobile instruction (M-instruction or M-Learning). Serious games are ones that are meant to be more than just entertainment. They have a serious use to educate or promote other types of activity. Immersive Games frequently involve many players interacting in a shared rich and complex  perhaps web-based - mixed reality world, where their circumstances will be multi and varied. Their reality may be augmented and often self-composed, as in a user-defined avatar in a virtual world. M-instruction and M-Learning is learning on the move; much of modern computer use is via smart devices, pads, and laptops. People use these devices all over the place and thus it is a natural extension to want to use these devices where they are to learn. This presents a problem if we wish to evaluate the effectiveness of the pedagogic media they are using. We have no way of knowing their situation, circumstance, education background and motivation, or potentially of the customisation of the final software they are using. Getting to the end user itself may also be problematic; these are learning environments that people will dip into at opportune moments. If access to the end user is hard because of location and user self-personalisation, then one solution is to look at the software before it goes out. Heuristic Evaluation allows us to get User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) experts to reflect on the software before it is deployed. The effective use of heuristic evaluation with pedagogical software [ 1 ] is extended here, with existing Heuristics Evaluation Methods that make the technique applicable to Serious Immersive Games and mobile instruction (M-instruction). We also consider how existing Heuristic Methods may be adopted. The result represents a new way of making this methodology applicable to this new developing area of learning technology.",NULL,NULL
539,"Serious Game on Flood Risk Management","The applications of using serious games as a teaching tool are vast. One of the fields of knowledge that is now being implemented in serious games is Disaster Relief Management. Serious games use a variety of multimedia and strategies that allow the learner to participate in a graphic simulation of a disaster. This work gamifies the topic of flood risk management. Floods are a unique type of disaster in that they have an element of predictability. This predictability can be utilized as a gaming element involving time limits to reduce the amount of destruction and loss of life due to flooding. Of the many benefits of using games for educational purposes, it can help people who live in rural areas who may have limited education comprehend this complex material in a meaningful way. A learning approach called Kolbs Learning Model is used to convey the material. It familiarizes people with the different responses and terminologies of the hazard while achieving high concentration and interest from the learner. After developing this game, the effectiveness of this gaming method is analyzed by a comparative study of text book learning and this serious game.",NULL,NULL

541,"Indirect Reports as Language Games","In this chapter I deal with indirect reports in terms of language games. I try to make connections between the theory of language games and the theory of indirect reports, in the light of the issue of clues and cues. Since indirect reporting is a social praxis, it is not surprising that it should be regimented by conventions of use. We hope to throw light on the nature of such conventions by using the notion of language game by Wittgenstein, which requires an essentially dialogic view of language. In language as dialogue, indirect reporting plays an important role, because, as we shall see in a subsequent chapter, an indirect report is a dialogic notion (the notion of footing is relevant to coming to a fuller understanding of this concept). By this chapter we are opening up a road conducive to a more dialogic view of indirect reporting. For the time being, suffice it to say that, for its understanding, an indirect report requires resorting to cues and clues that are visible in the context of the indirect reporting, while cues and clues of the original context are not available to the current participants. This explains why presuppositions (in that-clauses of indirect reports) have to be read with reference to the context of indirect reporting and not of the original speech act reported.",NULL,NULL
542,"Social and Community Networks and Obesity","The aim of the paper is to describe the first results of a research about therapeutic education, with biofeedback and personalization taking into account the place of a chronic patient inside his social network. The techniques used are (i) serious games in their pedagogical dimension of elaboration of therapeutic education scenarios and their local dimension of information capture using specific sensors and biofeedback processes allowing the customization of the game and (ii) tools of visualization of social networks to which the patient belongs, in order to bring him to an awareness of belonging to a community sharing the same pathology and therapy. We built three scenarios, dealing with (i) the dietary of a type II diabetic, (ii) the detection and monitoring of diabetic retinitis, and (iii) the detection and monitoring of diabetic foot ulcers. We have also developed a software for the representation of the dynamics of a new category of social network called homophilic. The introduction of computer techniques such as serious games and biofeedback processing in the field of therapeutic education is not new and dates about 10 years, but the coupling with individual identification techniques in a social group for the visualization and customization of the game is original. The joint use of new educational methods of therapeutic education, combined with the recognition of the presence of the patient in a local social network of people suffering from the same disease, will maximize the effectiveness of serious games and biofeedback necessary to the educational personalization.",NULL,NULL
543,"A Grammar-Based Framework for Rehabilitation Exergames","Numerous serious exergames advocate the use of engaging avatars to motivate a consistent exercise regimen. However, the process of specifying the prescribed exercise, implementing it as avatar animation, and developing an accurate feedback-providing mechanism is complex and requires a high level of expertise in game engines, control languages, and hardware devices. Furthermore, in the context of rehabilitation exergames, the requirements for accurate assessment and timely and precise feedback can be quite stringent. At the same time, the Kinect $$^{TM}$$ motion-capture sensor offers a natural interface to game consoles, and its affordability and wide availability represents a huge opportunity for at-home exergames. In this paper, we describe our work towards a system that envisions to simplify the process of developing rehabilitation exergames with Kinect $$^{TM}$$ . The system relies on a language for specifying postures and movements between them, and includes an editor that enables rehabilitation therapists to specify the prescribed exercise, by editing a demonstration of the exercise. This exercise-specification grammar is used to drive the animation of an avatar and the provision of quality feedback, by comparing the players postures (as captured by the Kinect $$^{TM}$$ ) against those of the coaching avatar and the grammar.",NULL,NULL

548,"A Comparison of Film and Computer Generated Imagery Medium for the Learning of Chimpanzee Behaviours","Knowledge of social interactions between animals has traditionally been passed on through observation and standard teaching materials such as lectures, books and documentaries. Serious games may be well suited to teaching animal behavior as they allow for easy control of what is being presented as well as interaction, in terms of moving around the environment and effecting behaviour of the virtual animals. We compare how the visual qualities of computer generated imagery (CGI) and film impact on learning and enjoyment. The reason for this comparison was partly as other work has shown how some human behaviour can be more easily communicated using CGI and to allow the impact of visual qualities to be better understood before studying the interactive CGI environments. Our findings suggest that when viewpoint is fixed people can identify animal behaviour equally well in both mediums. This validates further experimentation into the advantages of free viewpoint.",NULL,NULL

It is argued that a gamified modality would help overcome some limiting contextual constraints while preserving the seriousness of the intervention purpose. To support this last point, the paper describes two studies (N=227, N=81 respectively). The first study was conducted in the field; it was found that after a game session, users self-reported awareness of nightlife risks increased significantly from pre-session scores. In addition, users evaluated the intervention as credible in terms of its accuracy, novelty, and contextual appropriateness. The second study showed, under controlled laboratory conditions, that the number of correct answers about substance consumption consequences, substance characteristics, and risk prevention choices improved after the game session. Together, these studies suggest that using gamification as an attractor would not compromise the serious goals of this intervention modality.",NULL,NULL
551,"The Design of an Immersive Mobile Virtual Reality Serious Game in Cardboard Head-Mounted Display for Pain Management","Researchers have proved immersive Virtual Reality (VR) to be an effective method and non-pharmacological analgesic for distracting acute pain and chronic pain, and for reducing anxiety levels. VR has been developed and deployed in pain management contexts in medical settings for dental and medical procedures, as well to manage cancer and burn pain. Often, what patients are distracted by can typically be described as immersive VR games. Although this is promising, and although the cost of VR has dramatically fallen in the past few years, most VR systems are still comparatively expensive in terms of accessibility for patients in their everyday contexts, such as at home or at work. For most patients  especially chronic pain patients  it is important that pain-related VR is accessible when it is needed, or just needed. However, the so-called Cardboard VR is affordable enough for everyday use. It provides a low-cost stereoscopic display that patients attached to smartphones. Therefore, a mobile VR game has been designed, developed and tested for this purpose. This paper describes the game design and game mechanics of Cryoblast , a mobile VR game for self-managing pain. We introduce the design of the gameplay and pain metaphors, and believe it will inspire more mobile VR games for healthcare.",NULL,NULL

More precisely, our research objective is to propose models and tools that allow the user (learner, teacher or expert, depending on the context of application) to create coherent profiles consistent with domain knowledge. Our approach has been conceived and developed in the context of the platform GOALS. GOALS, as Generator Of Adaptive Learning Scenarios, is an online platform which allows the generation of learning scenarios, keeping into account the educational and entertaining aspects of serious games. For this, the knowledge in GOALS is organized into three layers: the domain concepts, the pedagogical resources, and the game resources. The profile is represented by a set of couples in the form <attribute, value>, where attribute corresponds to a concept, and value represents the learner competence in that concept. The profile is initialized by the user. During the game session, the profile is updated automatically according to dependencies among different domain concepts.

It is during their serious pursuits that leisure participants are eudaimonic, are living according to the daimon. The casual leisure activities are hedonic. The third form constituting the SLP  project-based leisure  is also eudaimonic but significantly more weakly so than the serious pursuits. The SLP is set out in detail sufficient to portray how eudaimonism and hedonism are experienced in modern leisure. A treatment of the relationship of the SLP to well-being rounds out the chapter. Here the concept of optimal leisure lifestyle is used to show how all three forms of the Perspective can contribute to personal well-being. That is, both eudaimonism and hedonism are important ingredients in the recipe for a life of lasting happiness. In this regard, Self-efficacy and personal agency are discussed as two critical processes that generate eudaimonia, a state that can, however, be undermined by unchecked selfishness.",NULL,NULL
562,"Bred and Meet: Gangs and God in East London","Religion has a time-honoured role in consummating the status of both the newcomer and the departed, and providing succour to those facing persecution. In networks wherein notions of respect and honesty are stressed but are best defined by notions of fate, violence and death, it is perhaps unsurprising that appeals of various kinds are often directed to a higher power. In what follows analysis focuses on the role of religion in Serious Youth Violence (SYV)/gang interventions in contemporary East London. Specifically, we examine the work of Pentecostal Christian charity, Teaching Against Gangs (TAG), and the ways in which its founder, Sheldon Thomas, draws on the repertoires of Christianityalongside what might be considered Realist Criminologyin imploring young men to turn their backs on the Road/gang life. Those On the Road operate within an underground economy pervaded by notions of respect, trespass and business enforceable by both threatened and actual violence. The Road Man can vary in age from mid-teens to mid-20s. The Elders in such gatherings are assumed to be involved in more consequential and lucrative criminal enterprises than the Youngers. The former are also presumed capable of more grievous forms of violence. Jail time and serious wounding typify life On the Road. As a consequence some people have made it their lifes work to offer an alternative way of living. Here the extant literature on religion and organised crime is surveyed, before the methods employed in the research and the settings in which TAG interventions were staged are considered. The strategies and realities of the interventions themselves are then detailed.

We examine of the core principles of serious game design and examine the current use of these principles in computer-based interventions for individuals with autism. Participants who undergo these computer-based interventions often show little evidence of the ability to generalize such learning to novel, everyday social communicative interactions. This lack of generalized learning may result, in part, from the limited use of fundamental elements of serious game design that are known to maximize learning.

A pilot run, with 48 participants in the age group of 1574years, conducted in India, indicates that the challenge before the social sector in India is to create awareness and image building of the sector, to conduct training and workshops, attract more people and organizations to participate in their activities, and possibly make it an integral part of the education system. The board game version can be adopted in electronic format for a wider reach. In a vast country like India, the latter game version can also overcome the traditional barriers of education, language, cost and time to spread awareness on social issues. The social entrepreneurship board game shows the effectiveness of serious games for awareness creation and its potential to impact the thought process. It is an effective method of learning for topics and subjects, in which people normally would not invest in terms of time, efforts and money. This is corroborated by the FloodSim experience in London which used a serious game for a similar objective. Serious games could be designed to address specific social issues like civic discipline, sanitation, health, hygiene, water, power, and environmental protection.",NULL,NULL
565,"Investigating the effects of motion-based Kinect game system on user cognition","Kinect, which is useful as a multimodal input device, offers multiple features such as voice recognition, facial tracking, object recognition, and gesture recognition. Games with such human-centred, interactive interfaces create an environment that bridges between artificial and natural cognitive capabilities, enabling them to work together more efficiently. This study specifically examines a usability evaluation method that uses Kansei engineering knowledge to identify and remedy difficulties related to user interface development. As a practical application of the suggested evaluation method, we used a particular serious game, The Glider, a prototype developed by Serious Games Finland. It exploits Kinect as its game controller. Serious games are usually aimed at promoting specific effects that can be achieved through playing the game. However, such effects can also present tradeoffs in terms of usability. Controlling motions in The Glider has been developed in close cooperation with medical doctors, physiotherapists, and patients in terms of well-being and light exercise. However, modulating the difficulty balance and usability of the game is also a very important aspect of game development. As described in this paper, our goal is to evaluate the control motion of the game from a usability perspective. Evaluation consists of state and appearance observations conducted with 12 Japanese subjects. Observed data were tagged into several categories to quantize their behaviours and speeches, and were analysed using both cognitive bias evaluation and statistical evaluation. Results show that difficulties for subjects in control motions of the game were curved out, which is a key to balancing usability and difficulty while maintaining the genuine purpose of the serious game.",NULL,NULL
566,"Determinants of hospital length of stay for people with serious mental illness in England and implications for payment systems: a regression analysis","Background Serious mental illness (SMI), which encompasses a set of chronic conditions such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and other psychoses, accounts for 3.4m (7%) total bed days in the English NHS. The introduction of prospective payment to reimburse hospitals makes an understanding of the key drivers of length of stay (LOS) imperative. Existing evidence, based on mainly small scale and cross-sectional studies, is mixed. Our study is the first to use large-scale national routine data to track English hospitals LOS for patients with a main diagnosis of SMI over time to examine the patient and local area factors influencing LOS and quantify the provider level effects to draw out the implications for payment systems. Methods We analysed variation in LOS for all SMI admissions to English hospitals from 2006 to 2010 using Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES). We considered patients with a LOS of up to 180days and estimated Poisson regression models with hospital fixed effects, separately for admissions with one of three main diagnoses: schizophrenia; psychotic and schizoaffective disorder; and bipolar affective disorder. We analysed the independent contribution of potential determinants of LOS including clinical and socioeconomic characteristics of the patient, access to and quality of primary care, and local area characteristics. We examined the degree of unexplained variation in provider LOS. Results Most risk factors did not have a differential effect on LOS for different diagnostic sub-groups, however we did find some heterogeneity in the effects. Shorter LOS in the pooled model was associated with co-morbid substance or alcohol misuse (4days), and personality disorder (8days). Longer LOS was associated with older age (up to 19days), black ethnicity (4days), and formal detention (16days). Gender was not a significant predictor. Patients who self-discharged had shorter LOS (20days). No association was found between higher primary care quality and LOS. We found large differences between providers in unexplained variation in LOS. Conclusions By identifying key determinants of LOS our results contribute to a better understanding of the implications of case-mix to ensure prospective payment systems reflect accurately the resource use within sub-groups of patients with SMI.",NULL,NULL
567,"The use of serious games in science education: a review of selected empirical research from 2002 to 2013","This research aims to systematically review the empirical studies on the use of serious games in science education from 2002 to 2013. To this end, the Science Citation Index and the Social Science Citation Index databases were used as the literature sources and a total of 53 empirical studies were identified as the review targets. A coding scheme including three major dimensions, namely, the game, pedagogy and research method dimensions, was developed, and, with this coding scheme, a series of content analyses were conducted. These analyses identified several significant research trends among the empirical studies using serious games in science education published from 2002 to 2013, including the following: (1) a surge of interest in the use of serious games in science education was revealed; (2) adventure/role-playing games were the most popular game type used in the reviewed empirical studies; (3) knowledge construction was the major learning goal of these serious games used in science educational settings; (4) most of the reviewed studies were concerned with interdisciplinary learning; (5) relatively fewer studies explicitly introduced the educational theoretical foundations for using serious games in science education or the instructional strategies coupled with the use of serious games; (6) quantitative research designs constituted the most commonly used research approach; and (7) a majority of the reviewed studies focused on investigating the effectiveness of serious games from the perspective of cognitive outcomes.

569,"Framework for personalized and adaptive game-based training programs in health sport","This paper describes an interdisciplinary approach towards a framework for personalized, game-based training programs for elderly and handicapped people. Adaptation and personalization are proposed as a way to increase the physiological training effects of game-based training programs (exergames). Hereby, the diversity of users and a broad range of physiological handicaps are considered. The framework is based on scientific training programs enhanced by technical methods and concepts for personalized exergames. This includes an authoring environment (StoryTec) which supports game designers and domain experts (sport scientists, medical doctors, therapists, etc.) in the development process and the (personalized) configuration of such exergames. Two prototypically implemented applications (ErgoActive and BalanceFit) demonstrate the usability and adaptation of the underlying training and game concepts for different user groups and provide indicators of the effectiveness and efficiency of the generic framework for particular user groups. For instance, ErgoActive is applicable for people of all ages and both trained and untrained users by being able to provide personalized training levels to improve endurance. Similarly, BalanceFit is useful both for wheelchair and walking frame users in order to maintain and possibly even increase their balance, strength and muscular coordination.",NULL,NULL

571,"Is Treating Motor Problems in DCD Just a Matter of Practice and More Practice?","Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) is often called a motor learning deficit. The question addressed in this paper is whether improvement of motor skills is just a matter of mere practice. Without any kind of intervention, children with DCD do not improve their motor skills generally, whereas they do improve after task-oriented intervention. Merely offering children the opportunity to practice motor skills, for instance by playing active video games, did lead to improved motor performance according to recent research findings, but to a lesser extent than task-oriented intervention. We argue that children with DCD lack the required motor problem-solving skills necessary to further improve their performance. Explicit motor teaching with an emphasis on developing these problem-solving skills is a necessary ingredient of intervention in DCD, leveraging the effectiveness of intervention above that of mere practicing.",NULL,NULL
572,"An oral health education video game for high caries risk children: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial","Background Tooth decay is the most common chronic disease of childhood in the world. Many children develop caries early in their lives, and go on to develop further caries and sepsis as they grow up, indicating failure in prevention. As a result, many end up requiring general anaesthesia to undergo treatment for a disease that is completely preventable. Previous studies have suggested that the families of these children need better oral health education as well as better support in implementing healthy practices at home, as they feel impeded by broader life challenges. Parents of these children have suggested utilizing modern technologies, such as the internet, DVDs and video games as methods of delivery of education that might fit in with their busy lifestyles. The aim of this investigation is to assess the acceptability and efficiency of an oral health education video game directed at these children and their families. Methods/Design A two-armed phase-II randomized controlled trial will assess a childrens oral health education video game in comparison with verbal oral health education in terms of: family satisfaction, effect on oral health knowledge, and effect on dietary and oral hygiene habits. Up to 110 four- to ten-year-old children, referred for tooth extraction under general anaesthesia due to caries, will be recruited. A sample of 45 participants in each group will be needed to provide 80 % statistical power. The primary outcome measures for this study are: (1) parent and child satisfaction with the intervention, as indicated using a visual analogue scale; (2) improvement in the childs dietary knowledge measured by a pictorial dietary quiz; and (3) changes in the childs diet and oral hygiene habits, measured using a childrens dietary questionnaire completed by the parent, and snacking and toothbrushing diaries completed by the child. Measures will be taken at baseline, directly after the intervention, and three months later. Discussion This study is a phase-II randomized controlled trial of an oral health education video game for high caries risk children and their families. Few protocols such as this are available in this much-needed research area. Trial registration ISRCTN94617251 .",NULL,NULL
573,"A Single Group Pre-posttest Examination of a Health and Wellness Intervention on Body Mass Index for Adolescent Females with Severe Emotional Disorders and Histories of Trauma","Youth living in residential treatment settings have an increased risk for developing health problems including overweight and obesity. Serious emotional disturbances (SEDs) coupled with psychiatric medications that can induce weight gain, a history of trauma, poor lifestyle behaviors, and high risk factors can contribute to overweight and obesity. Interventions designed to address the health and wellness of adolescents in residential care are critical to improving the outcomes for youth with a variety of comorbid physical and mental health disorders. The purpose of the current single group pre-posttest study was to examine the impact of a health and wellness group intervention on body mass index (BMI) and weight with adolescent females living in a residential treatment center (RTC). It was hypothesized that the wellness group intervention would improve BMI ranges and decrease weight. Convenience sampling methods were utilized and the total sample consisted of seven females who were receiving services within the RTC. Participants of the intervention were diagnosed with a SED, had a significant history of trauma, and had high rates of overweight and obesity. BMI and weight was measured by the RTC staff and data was analyzed using descriptive statistics including cross-tabulations. At pretesting, 85.7% of the participants were obese. Conversely, at posttesting, only 42.8% of the participants were in the obese BMI range. More specifically, one individual had moved into the healthy BMI range and two participants moved into the overweight BMI range. The average weight loss was 7.83 pounds per person ranging from 2 to 19 pounds. One participant was in the underweight BMI range at pretesting and had moved into the healthy weight range at posttesting. This pilot study has implications for both practice and research in all areas of child and adolescent wellness, including social work, psychology, health and medical, and educational disciplines. Health and wellness interventions can improve health and decrease weight and BMI for youth who are overweight or obese in residential settings. Limitations include a small sample size, the use of a single group pre-posttest design with no control group, and the use of convenience sampling.",NULL,NULL
574,"Adaptation in serious games for upper-limb rehabilitation: an approach to improve training outcomes","In this paper, we propose a game adaptation technique that seeks to improve the training outcomes of stroke patients during a therapeutic session. This technique involves the generation of customized game levels, which difficulty is dynamically adjusted to the patients abilities and performance. Our goal was to evaluate the effect of this adaptation strategy on the training outcomes of post-stroke patients during a therapeutic session. We hypothesized that a dynamic difficulty adaptation strategy would have a more positive effect on the training outcomes of patients than two control strategies, incremental difficulty adaptation and random difficulty adaptation. To test these strategies, we developed three versions of PRehab, a serious game for upper-limb rehabilitation. Seven stroke patients and three therapists participated in the experiment, and played all three versions of the game on a graphics tablet. The results of the experiment show that our dynamic adaptation technique increases movement amplitude during a therapeutic session.

578,"Can We Play with ADHD? An Alternative Game-Based Treatment for Inattentive Symptoms in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder","Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder presenting in early childhood with persistent, pervasive and impairing symptoms. It is also associated with other problematic mental health issues and negative outcomes, such as aggression, difficulties forming relationships and academic and occupational problems. Current standard treatments for ADHD include pharmacological treatments with stimulants and other medications, psychosocial interventions such as behavioural modifications, or a combination of both approaches (multi-modal approach consisting of parent education, medication and behaviour management for the child). There is interest in understanding effective non-pharmacological treatments for ADHD, given the temporary effects of medication and recent controversies on over-medicating children with ADHD. The use of neurofeedback treatment and cognitive training offers a promising new area for clinicians. We present a braincomputer interface (BCI)-based neurofeedback and cognitive training programme targeting the inattentive symptoms of ADHD in this chapter. The concept of an individualized model of attention is one of the features of the BCI training system. Incorporating this attention model into an innovative game targeted at ADHD children is another unique feature of this system. Recognizing the importance of validating serious games for the use of therapy, we have conducted several trials testing out the validity and playability of the BCI game, including a pilot phase and a larger randomized controlled trial. Currently, the future of this BCI-based treatment for ADHD is promising and we hope that, through our research efforts, it may prove to be an effective and viable treatment option that also appeals to the game-playing nature of children.",NULL,NULL
579,"Serious Games Analytics: Theoretical Framework","Serious Games is a unique industry that is concerned with the training/learning performance assessment of its clients. It is one of three digital technology industries (along with digital games, and online learning) that are rapidly advancing into the arena of analytics. The analytics from these industries all came from the tracing of user-generated data as they interacted with the systems, but differed from one another in the primary purposes for such analytics. For example, the purpose of game analytics is to support the growth of digital (entertainment) games, while that of learning analytics is to support the online learning industries. Although some game and learning analytics can indeed be used in serious games, they lack specific metrics and methods that outline the effectiveness of serious gamesan important feature to stakeholders. Serious Games Analytics need to provide ( actionable ) insights that are of values to the stakeholdersspecific strategies/policies to improve the serious games, and to (re)train or remediate play-learners for performance improvement. Since the performance metrics from one industry are unlikely to transfer well into another industry, those that are optimal for use in the Serious Games industry must be properly identified as Serious Games Analytics to properly measure, assess, and improve performance with serious games.",NULL,NULL

Particularly, Serious Games aim to develop specific objectives beyond entertainment, mainly, educational and training objectives. There is a novel perspective that uses serious games as an innovative tool in the field of health (health games). This paper belongs to that perspective due to its multidisciplinary perspective focused on neurosciences and computation. The main goal is to determine the frontal-lobe brain activity (executive functioning) while using videogames. The participants of the developed experiments were children from 8 to 12 years old whose executive functioning was evaluated using psychological assessments to obtain a cognitive profile and can validate the cognitive skills developed during the use of videogames, particularly, adventure-action genre. The analysis of brain activity was performed through an electroencephalography neuroheadset which collects brain signals during the physiological assessment and while users are playing videogames.

Key challenges include how to collect data without influencing its generation, and more fundamentally, how to collect and validate data from humans where a primary emphasis is on what people are thinking and doing. This chapter presents a meta-analysis of data collection activities in serious games research. A systematic review was conducted to consider metrics and measures across the humancomputer interaction, gaming, simulation, and virtual reality literature. The review focus was on the temporal aspect of data collection to identify if data is collected before, during, or after gameplay and if so what fundamental processes are used to collect data. The review found that the majority of data collection occurred post-game, then pre-game, and finally during gameplay. This reflects traditional difficulties of capturing gameplay data and highlights opportunities for new data capture approaches oriented towards data analytics. Also we identify how researchers gather data to answer fundamental questions about the efficacy of serious games and the design elements that might underlie their efficacy. We suggest that more standardized and better-validated data collection techniques, that allow comparing and contrasting outcomes between studies, would be beneficial.",NULL,NULL

596,"Analytics-Driven Design: Impact and Implications of Team Member Psychological Perspectives on a Serious Games (SGs) Design Framework","The number of educational or serious games (SGs) available to educators has increased in recent years as the cost of game development has been reduced. A benefit of SGs is that they employ not only lesson content but also knowledge contexts where learners can connect information to its context of use with active participation and engagement. This, in turn, improves learners ability to recall, integrate, and apply what they learn. Much of the research on game analytics has examined learner in-game trails to build predictive models that identify negative learner actions (e.g., systematic guessing after the fact). However, analytics can also be used in the game design and development phases. Drawing on evidence-centered design (ECD), the chapter outlines ways that analytics can drive the development of scenarios and activities in a game and thus allows SGs to function as contextual apprenticeships, providing robust assessment opportunities. We describe how ECD theory was applied in a project to develop and test a SG that trains people to reduce their reliance on cognitive biases. We describe instances during the design process where our team encountered obstacles due to differing psychological and learning/teaching orientations, a topic rarely explored in the SG or ECD literature. Furthermore, we describe the final analytics-based game design features.

In a first round, an open-inquiry teaching strategy was used and the game was observed to have a strong impact on students understanding, though not in the desired way. On the basis of this evaluation and additional expert-review, the game was redesigned. Simultaneously classroom practice was improved accordingly. An extend teacher guide was developed, supporting teachers in switching between free gaming episodes in classroom and episodes of discussion and reflection. In the second round a strong impact on students conceptual understanding of electrical circuits was observed and the students showed fewer misconceptions. Moreover students spontaneously reported that the game had helped them to understand the subject. We conclude that multi-disciplinaire collaboration was essential for this result, and that teachers played a critically role in connecting the development of the game and classroom practice. The design research approach taken greatly helped to keep the teams focus on the educational output. Accordingly, the educational expert appeared to be best positioned to play a leading role. It was also concluded that when a suitable mental model is coherently represented in the games structure and layout (looks included), a serious game may significantly contribute to students conceptual understanding.",NULL,NULL
599,"The Future of Immersive Technologies and Serious Games","This presentation seeks to explore likely developments in immersive technologies (defined as those technologies and applications which so immerse us that we choose to spend our discretionary time, attention, and income on them) and serious games (defined as the use of video game technologies and applications for non-entertainment purposes). It argues that immersive technologies, serious games and gamification are likely to play a vital role in addressing some of the most important challenges faced by business and society in the twenty-first century. This paper examines some of the disruptive changes that have taken place in the last 50years as a result of digital technologies and their impact on our daily lives and illustrates the potential of these technologies to shape a more sustainable future.",NULL,NULL
600,"Exploring the Importance of Making in an Educational Game Design","Educational games have been employed in many settings as a means to engage young students. Different genres and applications of games have been used to improve learning experience. The design or making of games in learning activities has been linked to teaching of new skills. Within this paper we explore and discuss the differences of involving young students into the game design and development process compared to just playing an educational game. In particular, we designed an educational math-game and an activity that involves children in playing or modifying the game, and we performed a between groups experiment with sixty students of the second grade of middle school (12 to 13 years old). Students formed three equivalent groups of twenty. The first group played the game, the second engaged with re-designing and modifying the game and the third (control) group solved the same exercises (with the educational game) on paper. The results showed that the making group exhibits certain attitudinal benefits. Hence, our findings suggest that learning through games should include more than just playing a well-designed game, it should also consider the involvement of students with various making affordances.",NULL,NULL

603,"Serious Games for Elderly Continuous Monitoring","Information technology (IT) and serious games allow older population to remain independent for longer. Hence, when designing technology for this population, developmental changes, such as attention and/or perception, should be considered. For instance, a crucial developmental change has been related to cognitive speed in terms of reaction time (RT). However, this variable presents a skewed distribution that difficult data analysis. An alternative strategy is to characterize the data to an ex-Gaussian function. Furthermore, this procedure provides different parameters that have been related to underlying cognitive processes in the literature. Another issue to be considered is the optimal data recording, storing and processing. For that purpose mobile devices (smart phones and tablets) are a good option for targeting serious games where valuable information can be stored (time spent in the application, reaction time, frequency of use, and a long etcetera). The data stored inside the smartphones and tablets can be sent to a central computer (cloud storage) in order to store the data collected to not only fill the distribution of reaction times to mathematical functions, but also to estimate parameters which may reflect cognitive processes underlying language, aging, and decisional process.",NULL,NULL
604,"Prevention in Addiction: Using Serious Games to (re)train Cognition in Dutch Adolescents","Excessive use of psychoactive substances during adolescence poses a serious health risk. It can lead to cognitive impairment, as well as addictive problems later in life. Dual process models of addiction suggest that to counter this development, the overdeveloped automatic reactions to drug-related cues should be tempered and cognitive control functions should be strengthened. Recently, several training paradigms have been developed to (re)train these processes. While effective in long time users, most adolescents lack a motivation to train. To motivate them we have developed several serious games that incorporate these evidence-based training paradigms. This paper will present some of them and describe how they work.",NULL,NULL

This requires to customize the game so that the person attempts to change in his lifestyle and dietary habits, according to the specific advices given at relevant moments by the therapeutic monitoring. Thus, taking better account of alimentary and sedentary own habits, and those of his family or professionnel environment, it is possible to build a personalized educational tool, which evolves according the transformations of the pathotology (toward stabilization or to complication), taking into account an actimetry objectified by sensors, complementing and overlapping the information obtained by subjective reporting declarative procedures of dialogue with the virtual coach, during the game.

Nowadays most of in situ serious games have been supported by GPS but it is not suitable for a small-scale historic site. In this paper, we propose a location and object-based serious game application H-Treasure Hunt. H-Treasure hunt integrates location-based service with object-based sensors to find more exact location of artifacts at a historic site. In the game, the players wear Head Mounted Display (HMD) and explore a historic site interacting with artifacts to complete missions. In this way, H-Treasure Hunt will act as a tour guide helping users learn about the historic site and artifacts. The use of this application is to support cultural heritage teaching and learning as well as enhancing historical site visits.",NULL,NULL

SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model has been widely used to analyse infectious diseases such as influenza, smallpox, bioterrorism, to name a few. On the other hand, Agent-based model or Individual-based model begins to spread in recent years. The model enables to represent behaviour of each person in the computer. It also reveals the spread of an infection by simulation of the contact process among people in the model. The study designs a model based on Epsteins model in which several health policies are decided such as vaccine stocks, antiviral medicine stocks, the number of medical staff to infection control measures and so on. Furthermore, infectious simulation of Ebola haemorrhagic fever, which has not yet any effective vaccine, is also implemented in the model. As results of experiments using the model, it has been found that preventive vaccine, antiviral medicine stocks and the number of medical staff are crucial factors to prevent the spread. In addition, a health policy game against a new type of infectious disease is designed as a serious game.",NULL,NULL

PRESTOs models are used to drive NPCs (Non-Player Characters) in serious games, currently applied to emergency management and training in health environments (hospitals and such) even if the technology is not domain- nor game-specific. A number of requirements have led to the adoption of ontologies as the main classification and annotation mechanism of both the external world and the internal states of an NPC. Structuring and building these ontologies have been done by adopting a mixed top-down and bottom-up approach. The main results are (1) a top-level ontology inspired by the well-known DOLCE; (2) the structuring of the ontologies in composable domain-specific and individual sections; (3) a tool for the semi-automatic extraction of categories from the available virtual reality assets. This paper focuses on the ontology design, illustrated with a few practical examples.",NULL,NULL

614,"Modeling the efficacy of persuasive strategies for different gamer types in serious games for health","Persuasive games for health are designed to alter human behavior or attitude using various Persuasive Technology (PT) strategies. Recent years have witnessed an increasing number of such games, which treat players as a monolithic group by adopting a one-size-fits-all design approach. Studies of gameplay motivation have shown that this is a bad approach because a motivational approach that works for one individual may actually demotivate behavior in others. In an attempt to resolve this weakness, we conducted a large-scale study on 1,108 gamers to examine the persuasiveness of ten PT strategies that are commonly employed in persuasive game design, and the receptiveness of seven gamer personalities (gamer types identified by BrianHex) to the ten PT strategies. We developed models showing the receptiveness of the gamer types to the PT strategies and created persuasive profiles, which are lists of strategies that can be employed to motivate behavior for each gamer type. We then explored the differences between the models and, based on the results, proposed two approaches for data-driven persuasive game design. The first is the one-size-fits-all approach that will motivate a majority of gamers, while not demotivating any player. The second is the personalized approach that will best persuade a particular type of gamer. We also compiled a list of the best and the worst strategies for each gamer type. Finally, to bridge the gap between game design and PT researchers, we map common game mechanics to the persuasive system design strategies.",NULL,NULL

Recent research on the benefits of EG in rehabilitation settings, EGP, and EGE indicates that electronic methods are often equivalent to more traditional treatments and may be more enjoyable or acceptable, at least to some consumers. Methodological concerns include the lack of randomized controlled trials (RCT) for many applications. Suggestions are offered for using EG in therapeutic practice.",NULL,NULL
616,"Game-based practice versus traditional practice in computer-based writing strategy training: effects on motivation and achievement","Achieving sustained student engagement with practice in computer-based writing strategy training can be a challenge. One potential solution is to foster engagement by embedding practice in educational games; yet there is currently little research comparing the effectiveness of game-based practice versus more traditional forms of practice. In this study, the ARCS model (Keller, Perform Instr 26(8):17, 1987b ) was used to investigate the motivational characteristics of different practice conditions. To this end, 175 students were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions: game-based, question-based, model-based, and writing-based practice. All students first learned strategies to write an essay introduction. Subsequently, students practiced using the strategies in the four different conditions. Game-based practice was expected to positively affect ARCS-related motivation toward practice. Results showed that students perceived game-based practice as significantly more interesting and engaging than question-based practice. However, although game-based practice was perceived more positively, only model-based and question-based practice demonstrated a beneficial impact on students ability to implement the writing strategies. These results underline the necessity of interconnecting motivational and instructional design when developing practice methods for computer-based writing strategy training.",NULL,NULL
617,"Developing a cognitive evaluation method for serious game engineers","Serious game is an application that has been recently designed for a specific purpose in areas such as education, healthcare, management, and engineering with the core components in games. There have been recent attempts to evaluate the effects of serious games through cognitive aspects used in empirical research, yet there are struggles for application designers to apply these cognitive neuroscientific principles to validate their proposed programs. In this paper, simple tools in cognitive psychology are introduced for analyzing serious game designs through empirical testing. The experiment is designed to investigate the effects of a tangible walking game on attention, memory, and emotion. Results revealed that the group that directly played the tangible walking game showed a slightly better performance on word recall than the control group that just watched the game. We are proposing, in this paper, an experimental method for validating a tangible walking game that can be potentially applied to other serious games. A cognitive evaluation procedure has been developed showing how to exploit simple empirical testing to validate the effectiveness of the proposed tangible game through the cognitive aspects of information processing.",NULL,NULL
618,"Facing the challenge of teaching emotions to individuals with low- and high-functioning autism using a new Serious game: a pilot study","Background It is widely accepted that emotion processing difficulties are involved in Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC). An increasing number of studies have focused on the development of training programs and have shown promising results. However, most of these programs are appropriate for individuals with high-functioning ASC (HFA) but exclude individuals with low-functioning ASC (LFA). We have developed a computer-based game called JeStiMulE based on logical skills to teach emotions to individuals with ASC, independently of their age, intellectual, verbal and academic level. The aim of the present study was to verify the usability of JeStiMulE (which is its adaptability, effectiveness and efficiency) on a heterogeneous ASC group. We hypothesized that after JeStiMulE training, a performance improvement would be found in emotion recognition tasks. Methods A heterogeneous group of thirty-three children and adolescents with ASC received two one-hour JeStiMulE sessions per week over four weeks. In order to verify the usability of JeStiMulE, game data were collected for each participant. Furthermore, all participants were presented before and after training with five emotion recognition tasks, two including pictures of game avatars (faces and gestures) and three including pictures of real-life characters (faces, gestures and social scenes). Results Descriptive data showed suitable adaptability, effectiveness and efficiency of JeStiMulE. Results revealed a significant main effect of Session on avatars (ANOVA: F (1,32) = 98.48, P < .001) and on pictures of real-life characters (ANOVA: F (1,32) = 49.09, P < .001). A significant Session  Task  Emotion interaction was also found for avatars (ANOVA: F (6,192) = 2.84, P = .01). This triple interaction was close to significance for pictures of real-life characters (ANOVA: F (12,384) = 1.73, P = .057). Post-hoc analyses revealed that 30 out of 35 conditions found a significant increase after training. Conclusions JeStiMulE appears to be a promising tool to teach emotion recognition not only to individuals with HFA but also those with LFA. JeStiMulE is thus based on ASC-specific skills, offering a model of logical processing of social information to compensate for difficulties with intuitive social processing.

This chapter examines specifically the design of Head Up Games, which are outdoor games that support embodied interaction and where players are collocated, e.g., in a playground, alley, park; the traditional loci of childrens play over centuries. Designing such games and the emerging gaming experience presents its own set of challenges, such as designing the interaction of a group, ensuring pace in the game, and fairness for different contexts and groups of players. Not least, the added value of enhancing outdoor play and games with technology needs to be ensured.

For children, however, such repetitive daily exercises become a burden and may lead to confrontation with the family. Using a system comprised of a PEP mask, a computer-connected pressure monitor and a suite of games of varying types, a series of tests will determine with both objective statistics and subjective feedback how effective the system is at encouraging children and young adults to participate in daily therapy. With longer and more advanced games, coupled with unobtrusive data gathering functionality, we determine what effect long-term use of such a game system has on young sufferers. The study has shown that games based PEP physiotherapy is a desirable, viable alternative that can perform at least similarly to the existing approaches in terms of the amount of time children spend engaging in breathing exercises and with potentially many additional benefits including the capture of detailed data about the amount and quality of physiotherapy which is currently impossible with conventional, non-computerized methods.",NULL,NULL

625,"Healthcare Training Enhancement Through Virtual Reality and Serious Games","There has been an increase in the use of immersive 3D virtual environments and serious games, that is, video games that are used for educational purposes, and only recently serious games have been considered for healthcare training. For example, there are a number of commercial surgical simulators which offer great potential for the training of basic skills and techniques, if the tedium of repeated rehearsal can be overcome. It is generally recognized that more abstract problem-solving and knowledge level training needs to be incorporated into simulated scenarios. This chapter explores some examples of what has been developed in terms of teaching models and evaluative methodologies, then discusses the educational theories explaining why virtual simulations and serious games are an important teaching tool, and finally suggests how to assess their value within an educational context. The tasks being trained span several levels of abstraction, from kinematic and dynamic aspects to domain knowledge training. The evaluation of the trainee at each level of this hierarchy necessitates objective metrics. We will describe a unifying framework for evaluation of speed and accuracy of these multi-level tasks needed for validating their effectiveness before inclusion in medical training curricula. In addition, specific case studies will be presented and research results brought forward regarding the development of virtual simulations, including those for neurosurgical procedures, EMS training, and patient teaching modules.",NULL,NULL

While thousands of games have been created, there is little evidence that such games do persuade or contribute to behavior change. To address this problem, address the research question: How do elements of the different models of persuasion and behavior change manifest within Games for Change? We identify and focus on three models: Information Deficit, Procedural Rhetoric, and a new model called Emergent Dialogue. To answer this question, we had to determine what clues there were in games that we could use to identify each model of persuasion. Using a collaborative version of a Close Reading methodology we analyzed ten Games for Change about sustainability. Based on our results we propose six categories of design markers. Each marker can be used to identify or implement specific design elements associated with a particular model of persuasion. In this chapter, we describe our methodology, present six categories of design markers, and describe the specific strategies for each marker associated with each of the three models of persuasion. We illustrate each model and its design markers through canonical examples including a new game called Youtopia that we have created to encode the Emergent Dialogue model into a digital game.

654,"Applying HOPSCOTCH as an exer-learning game in English lessons: two exploratory studies","This article describes HOPSCOTCH, a design concept for an exer - learning game to engage elementary school children in learning. Exer-learning is a new genre of digital learning games that combines playing and learning with physical activity (exercise). HOPSCOTCH is a first design concept for exer-learning games that can be applied to support the acquisition of factual knowledge. HOPSCOTCH is based on the popular playground game in which a course is drawn on the pavement with numbers that indicate the course to be hopped. In two exploratory studies at a German elementary school, we investigated the potential of HOPSCOTCH to engage students, as well as to facilitate the acquisition of factual knowledge (English vocabulary) and to improve the attitudes of students towards learning English as a second language. The results of these studies indicated that the students remembered and correctly spelled about the same number of new vocabulary words after learning with HOPSCOTCH as they did after a teacher-centred lesson. Importantly however, the students enjoyed playing this exer-learning game very much and they reported better attitudes towards studying English after learning vocabulary with HOPSCOTCH compared to a teacher-centred lesson. These encouraging first results support the assumption that HOPSCOTCH as a design concept may have the potential to actively engage players in learning activities leading to a virtuous circle of reduced low level disruption and self-exclusion, increased assimilation of knowledge and greater engagement in lessons to the benefit of the whole class, not just the better-motivated individual. As such we suggest that exer-learning games could serve as additional classroom control and teaching aids in schools.",NULL,NULL

One aspect of this training relates to their knowledge of the Rules of the Road or COLREGS; the rules for the manoeuvring and signalling that approaching vessels make in order to avoid collision. The training and assessment exercises undertaken predominantly use non-interactive static materials. These do not exercise the required skill in reconciling information from maritime charts, radar displays and out-of-the-window monitoring. Consequently, performance during assessment on the VR-based bridge simulator falls short. This paper describes The Rules of the Road SIMulator (RORSIM)a proof of concept interactive 3D (i3D) simulator developed to bridge the training gap between classroom teaching and VR bridge simulator assessment. RORSIMs differentiation and its key functionality in terms of visualisaton, physics/interaction and game mechanics are influenced by the consideration of pedagogical learning models during requirements capture.

656,"Designing collaborative multiplayer serious games","The idea of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) is being investigated for more than twenty years. Since a few years, game-based approaches like video games for learning (Serious Games) offer new fields of application. The combination of game-based learning concepts and collaborative learning may enable new, game-based application areas of CSCL, like collaborative multiplayer Serious Games. Designing such games, however, is very challenging as it requires to take into account traditional single player game design concepts, concepts for multiplayer game design, and concepts for Serious Game design simultaneously. Only very few examples of such games exist today. In this paper we describe an approach for the design of game-based collaborative learning scenarios using multiplayer Serious Games. Our approach aims at combining design concepts from the fields of collaborative learning and (multiplayer) game design. Our approach takes into account the requirements of traditional single player games (fun, narration, immersion, graphics, sound), challenges of multiplayer games (concurrent gaming, interaction) and Serious Game design (seamless inclusion of learning content, adaptation and personalization). Furthermore, requirements of collaborative learning are considered, like group goals, positive interdependence, and individual accountability. Our design concept was used to create a collaborative 3D multiplayer game fostering collaborative behavior as a foundation for game-based collaborative learning in small teams. We performed a user study with eight gaming sessions and a total of 23 participants. Results showed that the game enables a collaborative gameplay and fosters collaborative behavior. This may allow us to use a game-based CSCL approach to combine the advantages of game-based learning with those of collaborative learning in future.",NULL,NULL

658,"The wise cursor: assisted selection in 3D serious games","In recent years, the evolution of 3D graphics hardware and software has lead to a growing interest for serious games in three-dimensional virtual environments for learning, training, and rehabilitation. Many of these games are based on a first-person-shooter paradigm in which users navigate through the environment, select, and manipulate virtual objects. The target users of these applications are not necessarily usual gamers, and they often have difficulties in navigating and interacting in the 3D environment. This paper proposes the wise cursor , a new method for selection that improves the usability and accessibility of mouse-driven serious games in 3D environments. At each user click, the proposed method computes a list of objects candidates to be selected and their probability of being the desired one. Depending on the uncertainty of the probability distribution, either one object is selected or a mechanism to clarify the selection is proposed. In the former case, if the selected object is within the user avatars scope, the action associated to it is realized, otherwise the application automatically navigates toward it. In this way, selection and navigation are eased. The empirical results of the usability tests show that this technique is fast, practical, and that it requires little users skills. Thus, it can make serious games usable for a wider range of users who can concentrate on the training objectives without technological barriers.",NULL,NULL

We have developed a Facebook-based online game called HInVaders as a case study for our research. In the HInVaders game, the player is a HIV virus molecule and his aim is infecting as many people as possible. When the game starts, the molecule has already infected a person and is located inside the infected body. During the gameplay, the player encounters treatments (e.g. antiretroviral therapy) represented using the pill metaphor, and the human immune system (e.g. white blood cells). The player has to avoid the treatments and to attack the immune system in order to increase his score (called viral load). As a side effect (from the virus point of view), the viral load increase cause a decrease in the infected person's health level (as highlighted in the game interface). If the molecule/player goes through the same body too long, he will die with the infected person. Therefore, it is important for the player to explore the possibilities to escape from the infected body by infecting other persons exploiting some events, which occur during the gameplay. We have conducted some preliminary tests to assess the game didactical effectiveness on a small group of adults.

Challenges to their adoption and use includes the cost of development and the need to provide evidence of effectiveness. However, an equally pressing dilemma facing the establishment of a market for SGs is the general commoditization of digital media and erosion (diminution) of economic value. Given the substantial upheaval in the entertainment games, software, music, book publishing, and newspaper industries, it seems unlikely that SGs for health will be immune from such market pressures if they persist in being conceptualized and designed as products. The solution is to switch business strategy by re-conceptualizing and designing SGs for health as networked services. The benefits will include personalization, integration with health administration systems, and importantly, the ability control access and therefore the adoption of pay-per-use revenue models, and ultimately the preservation of value.",NULL,NULL

These results, partly due to the visual impact and immersion achieved, encourage investigating the purposeful design of games for deployment in a variety of dentist treatments. In fact, a large group of patients, particularly youngsters, experience a strong resistance or even aversion to visiting a dentist's practice, often due to previous distressing and painful experiences. We argue that, to solve such situations, distracting a patient with just an attractive virtual environment is less efficient than with an interactive game expressly designed for this context and purpose. This paper presents the first results of a pilot project in this direction. We discuss the various requirements gathered throughout the project, and describe several technological challenges, involving e.g. user experience, interaction, content, graphics, which we faced throughout the game design and development phases.

Key in this study is the hypothesis that meaningful play can be achieved by designing for figural transfer by the use of metaphorical recontextualisation. The Game Transfer Model (GTM) is introduced as a tool for designing and thinking about serious game design, stretching the possibilities from high-fidelity simulations to metaphorical fantasy worlds. Key for in-game learning experience is the presence of conceptual continuity defined by the congruence of fidelity-elements. The GTM differentiates between realisticness and realism. Where simulations use the road of literal transfer and therefore relies on realisticness and high-fidelity, figural transfer can be a guiding principle for serious game design, using metaphorical recontextualisation to maintain conceptual continuity. Conceptual continuity aligns fidelity and enables the game to connect its serious content to the realities of life.",NULL,NULL

It defines its place and time, temporalizes it to towards a future goal and is key in creating audience immersion and belief in what we see. The process of recording, manipulating or designing audio elements is usually handled by competent professionals. Can a different approach be had to the way we design sound ambiences and what relationship and role does ambient sound have to media such as film and games? Using object-oriented programming environment, Max/MSP, a low-cost serious gaming interface was designed and implemented  the Ambience Designer. This rids the process of its esoteric nature and together with an especially crafted tabletop interface allows amateurs to design and interact with the ambient sounds of birds, wind and traffic for home movies and indie games. The Ambience Designer removes the esoteric ways of audio design in a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) and use intuitive user input that connect with our every day subjective experience of sound - such as distance, placement, and intensity - in place of parameters that only professionals could understand and use. Future developments include moving the Ambience Designer to a commercial multi touch table/tablet such as Microsoft Surface or Apple iPad which will enable us to utilise more intuitive, multi-touch gestures such as tap, scroll, pan, rotate, and pinch. The Ambience Designer was evaluated among working professionals, amateurs and the general public and initial findings were promising.

678,"What Makes Learning Fun? Exploring the Influence of Choice and Difficulty on Mind Wandering and Engagement during Learning","Maintaining learner engagement is critical for all types of learning technologies. This study investigated how choice over a learning topic and the difficulty of the materials influenced mind wandering, engagement, and learning during a computerized learning task. 59 participants were randomly assigned to a text difficulty and choice condition (i.e., self-selected or experimenter-selected topic) and measures of mind wandering and engagement were collected during learning. Participants who studied the difficult version of the texts reported significantly higher rates of mind wandering ( d = .41) and lower arousal both during ( d = .52) and after the learning session ( d = .48). Mind wandering and arousal were not affected by choice. However, participants who were assigned to study the topic they selected reported significantly more positive valence during ( d = .57) but not after learning. These participants also scored substantially higher on a subsequent knowledge test ( d = 1.27). These results suggest that choice and text difficulty differentially impact mind wandering, engagement, and learning and provide important considerations for the design of ITSs and serious games with a reading component.",NULL,NULL
679,"Designing Serious Videogames through Concept Maps","The purpose of this study was to present and evaluate a new technique through the use of concept maps for the design of serious videogames using Ejemovil Editor. This was accomplished by using a method to easily transform concept maps into directed graphs, which are then used to generate the videogame sequence and the interdependencies between the various elements. With this tool teachers are able to define the storyline of the videogame, incorporating the concepts that they want to teach in a structured way. To these ends, an editor was created using this methodology that allows for the construction of mobile videogames. Teachers that currently use concept maps have evaluated the proposed methodology. Preliminary results show that the proposed methodology for the design and creation of serious videogames for education is appropriate, easy to use, generally accepted and understandable for the end users.",NULL,NULL

681,"The Virtual Trillium Trail and the empirical effects of Freedom and Fidelity on discovery-based learning","The Virtual Trillium Trail is a new kind of desktop virtual reality application that crosses over into the area of geospatial, educational simulations. Visual fidelity significantly impacts intrinsic learning, activity in situ, and knowledge gained, independent of other factors. The main empirical contribution of this report is on the impact of the user interface design parameters of graphical fidelity and navigational freedom on learning outcomes. A planned orthogonal contrast, Two-way ANOVA with the factors of Visual Fidelity and Navigational Freedom both scaled, and set to high and low levelsshows significant impacts on the variables of Salient Events, a proxy for discovery-based learning , and Knowledge Gained, as measured between a pre-test and a post-test. Thus, there is strong empirical evidence to support the use of desktop virtual environments, built with high-fidelity, photo-realistic, and free navigational game engine technology, as educational simulations for informal education. The high-level Visual Fidelity combined with the high-level Navigational Freedom condition showed a mean learning gain of 37.44% and is significantly superior to the low-level Visual Fidelity , low-level Navigational Freedom condition, ceteris paribus .",NULL,NULL
682,"Serious games in prevention and rehabilitationa new panacea for elderly people?","Digital games cannot only be used for fun and entertainment. The term serious games (SG) denotes digital games serving serious purposes like education, training, advertising, research and health. Recently, a new generation of games has emerged involving whole-body movements. Compared to traditional interventions, these games may help elderly people to improve their health by enhancing physical fitness and coordinative abilities by combining increased motivation, game experience like fun and game flow and training. Serious games, particularly adventure and shooter games, already play an important role in health education, prevention and rehabilitation, e.g. to enhance health-related physical activity, improve sensorymotor coordination, prevent asthma, change nutrition behaviour and alleviate diabetes and prevent smoking or HIV. In this paper, the impact of SG on prevention and rehabilitation is discussed. Three criteria are applied. Beyond effectivity and efficiency, the additional benefits of serious games can be described and explained by different models including social, psychological, physiological and sensorymotor factors. The quality of study serves as a third criterion. Despite first promising results, there are only few high-quality studies. Adequate content, game interfaces, sustainability and appropriate settings are critical factors for the success of SG. In this regard, (sport) science can help to develop and evaluate SG and test appropriate settings that ensure sustainable use of serious games.",NULL,NULL
683,"Gesture-based mobile training of intercultural behavior","Cultural heuristics determine acceptable verbal and non-verbal behavior in interpersonal encounters and are often the main reason for problems in intercultural communication. In this article, we present an approach to intercultural training of non-verbal behaviors that makes use of enculturated virtual agents, i.e. interactive systems that take cultural heuristics for interpreting and generating behavior into account. Because current trends in intercultural training highlight the importance of a coaching approach, i.e. the ability to offer training units anytime and anywhere, the system was developed as a mobile solution taking the sensoric capabilities of smart phones into account for the user interaction in form of gesture recognition. After an introduction of the theoretical background on culture and enculturated systems, the system features are discussed in detail followed by an account of the application itself, emphasizing the importance of situated role-plays. Two evaluation studies are presented next that analyze the usability of the approach as well as the more important question of whether training with the system gives better results than traditional methods.",NULL,NULL

698,"Measuring learning in serious games: a case study with structural assessment","The effectiveness of serious games is often measured with verbal assessment. As an alternative we propose Pathfinder structural assessment (defined as measuring the learners knowledge organization and compare this with a referent structure) which comprises three steps: knowledge elicitation, knowledge representation and knowledge evaluation. We discuss practical and theoretical considerations for the use of structural assessment and showcase its application with the game Code Red: Triage. Results suggest that structural assessment measures an individuals understanding of a domain at least differently from verbal assessment. While verbal assessment may provide a more nuanced picture regarding declarative and procedural knowledge, structural assessment may add an in-depth understanding of the concepts that are regarded important in a domain. In the Discussion we propose four guidelines to effectively use structural assessment in serious games: (1) Determine the appropriateness of the domain for structural assessment, (2) select an appropriate referent for the target group(s), (3) select the number of concepts needed for structural assessment, and (4) consider the analysis of the graphical knowledge representations to obtain in-depth information about the quality of the knowledge structures.",NULL,NULL

700,"What Computing Students Can Learnby Developing Their Own Serious Games","Most serious games are developed for student use by professional programmers and educational researchers. However, when the target student population are computing science students, then further exploitation of serious games to support learning can be gained through asking the students to develop the serious games themselves. Much work has been undertaken in recent years in the fields of problem-based and other enquiry-based approaches to structure and drive more independent student learning. Generally such approaches involve organising students into teams, and requiring the student teams to solve problems over a period of time. Students gain many important soft skills such as communication, working with others, and time management. Enquiry-Based Learning (EBL) drives student learning by having them design and develop solutions to complex, non-trivial, real-world problems, that require them to bring together many different aspects of their chosen domain of learning, to solve a task. In recent years such EBL approaches have begun to be used in technical subjects such as engineering and computing science. A computer game is a very appealing deliverable to ask a team of computing students to develop, since they already have a clear idea of what the software system does, and the importance of the user interface. This chapter first reviews several fields of educational and computing research, before describing several case studies in which computing undergraduates were asked (or volunteered) to develop serious games as part of their studies. The chapter aims to form an argument for the benefits to computing students of becoming serious games developers, and attempts to frame that argument with reference to existing research and informal analysis of the case studies described.",NULL,NULL

702,"Serious Games for Health and Safety Training","EUROSTAT figures show that 5720 people die in the European Union every year as a consequence of work-related accidents. Training in Health and Safety is indeed a key aspect to reduce this figure, and serious games constitute an effective method to provide this training. However, the development of this type of computer applications is a complex issue, requiring cross discipline knowledge on different areas, including instructional design, psychology, sociology, law, and computer graphics. Beyond the challenges already present in the development of non-educational computer games, serious games for health and safety are instructional tools. Therefore, they require an instructional design to cover specific educational issues, and knowledge on the health and safety regulations which are applicable in each particular context. In addition, these games have as their ultimate goal to increase the workers awareness about safety regulations and reduce the number and seriousness of accidents. Thus, the evaluation of this type of applications must be rather different from the evaluation of other games with a focus on entertainment. In this chapter we provide a description of existing serious games in the health and safety area, and describe major instructional and technological aspects related to the development of this type of training tools. Although technological developments will indeed increase the advantages of serious games as a means to deliver instruction in health and safety, we believe that the most challenging issues remain at the instructional side, and further research is still needed to maximize the effectiveness of this kind of training.",NULL,NULL

A couple of experiments of using VR systems and games for stroke rehabilitation are highlighted in section 4 as examples to showcase the benefits and impacts of these technologies to conventional clinic practice. Finally, section 5 points some future directions of applying emerging games technologies in healthcare, such as augmented reality, Wii-mote motion control system, and even full body motion capture and controller free games technology demonstrated recently on E3 2009 which have great potentials to treat motor disorders, combat obesity, and other healthcare applications.",NULL,NULL
706,"Impact of the Feeling of Knowledge Explicitness in the Learners Participation and Performance in a Collaborative Game Based Learning Activity","Despite the growing interest in the Game Based Learning (GBL) literature (Squire, 2005; Gee, 2005), only a reduced number of studies have focused on the collaborative modality in GBL (Harteveld & Bekebrede, 2011). Knowledge Group Awareness (KGA) designates the intersubjective perception of teammates knowledge. The use of especially designed gaming interfaces allows KGA declaration and displaying support by the introduction of the KGA explicitness systems, called by some authors KGA tools (Buder, 2010). This paper aims to study whether a structured explicitness of the KGA could play a core role in facilitating and improving collaborative face to face GBL performances. The KGA is operationalized through the Feeling of Knowledge (FOK) declaration. The FOK refers to the feelings a student has regarding his/her knowledge for a specific subject (Hart, 1965), it is defined by the student using a Confidence Level (CL) based in a 3 level scale. We expect that the FOK declaration process will have a positive impact in the learning process based in the GBL task, both in individual and collaborative phases of the GBL activity proposed to the students. However, we expect better performances in collaborative settings with the explicitness of the KGA thanks to the socially shared metacognition process, developed through the displaying of the intersubjective FOK. For this purpose we designed a collaborative SG in the field of finance, introducing an ad hoc KGA explicitness system with the aim of supporting the students FOK declaration according to the 3 CL. The first is analyzing the impact of the declaration of the FOK in individual performance when playing alone. The second one is analyzing the influence of shared visualization of the intersubjective FOK in the individual and collaborative performances, according to the symmetry of knowledge between dyad members. This environment permits researchers study different variables in order to study four hypotheses on learners performances and changes in their Feeling of knowledge (FOK) accuracies during collaborative game experience.",NULL,NULL
707,"Modding in Serious Games: Teaching Structured Query Language (SQL) Using NeverWinter Nights","In recent development of educational technology, Games-based learning (GBL) or Serious Games (SG) has shown its potential to support learning. Compared to eLearning, SG is considered more fun to use because of its interactivity. However, this advantage does not come without a cost that needs to be considered. It is considerably more complex to design an SG application than it is to design an eLearning tool. It involves not only the resources required to design an enjoyable game but also a pedagogical design which can be implemented through the game and is suitable for the efficient delivery of a given subject matter. In eLearning, learning materials constitute the required resources which are then managed and presented by web scripts. However, in SG, the resources include graphical and non-graphical assets of the game as well as the learning materials. The assets can include text, diagram and 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) objects. These resources are usually designed according to the story and environment design of the game. The learning content must fit the game story and the environment so the learning content falls within the context of the game. The game also requires an interactive system that allows the player to input, interact and manipulate objects within the game environment. This system usually involves scripting and programming. It is not an easy task to combine all these elements and consequently the development of an SG application requires more time and effort than does one for eLearning. Commercial games are usually developed using complex game engines and tools. Some of the game developer companies have released game engines and tools that allow modification of the original game. The variant of the original game is called a mod. The mod is usually subject to commercial restrictions. However, modding is one of the potential solutions for the SG developers to create an SG application which looks like commercial games in considerably faster way. Since this facility was first introduced, there has been a growing interest in modifying or modding commercial games and there are now numerous online communities dedicated to various types of mods. One of the best-known mods tools is NeverWinter Nights 2 (NWN2). The tool has pre-defined graphical assets and basic functions which allow the developer to create a satisfactory 3D RPG game for educational purposes. The NWN2 engine and tool also allow scripting which makes it a flexible resource for the developer to create new functions when required. As an example, a SG application which is used to teach Structured Query Language (SQL) has been developed by the author. SQL is the standard database programming language and it is one of the essential skills required in information technology. In this chapter, the development life cycle of SG and commercial games mod tools currently available will be discussed. The chapter will then examine the design and development of an SG application to teach SQL.",NULL,NULL

716,"Developing serious games for cultural heritage: a state-of-the-art review","Although the widespread use of gaming for leisure purposes has been well documented, the use of games to support cultural heritage purposes, such as historical teaching and learning, or for enhancing museum visits, has been less well considered. The state-of-the-art in serious game technology is identical to that of the state-of-the-art in entertainment games technology. As a result, the field of serious heritage games concerns itself with recent advances in computer games, real-time computer graphics, virtual and augmented reality and artificial intelligence. On the other hand, the main strengths of serious gaming applications may be generalised as being in the areas of communication, visual expression of information, collaboration mechanisms, interactivity and entertainment. In this report, we will focus on the state-of-the-art with respect to the theories, methods and technologies used in serious heritage games. We provide an overview of existing literature of relevance to the domain, discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the described methods and point out unsolved problems and challenges. In addition, several case studies illustrating the application of methods and technologies used in cultural heritage are presented.",NULL,NULL
717,"Do Unstructured Routines Modify the Link Between Social-Psychological Strain and Adolescent Offending?","In this article, based on Agnews General Strain Theory (GST), main as well as interactive effects of social-psychological strain and unstructured routines in the explanation of petty crime and serious delinquency are studied in a general adolescent population. Data signify that family and school strain does relate to adolescent offending. However, chances of these types of strain leading to adolescent offending are highest amongst youth who do not engage in unstructured routines, which indicates that individual- and situational-based causes of offending have a great potential of being studied together. Strain resulting from a beloved person getting ill or passing away, on the other hand, only relates to adolescent offending through unstructured routines. Finally, it was found that strain mechanisms are more important in the explanation of serious delinquency than petty crime. Implications for further research as well as for the future of GST are discussed.",NULL,NULL
718,"Exer-Learning Games: Transferring Hopscotch from the Schoolyard to the Classroom","In this paper we present the idea of Exer-learning games - integrating the element of exercise into serious games. The combination of motion, learning and playing is assumed to facilitate intrinsic motivation and learning achievements. For the application of exer-learning games, the concept of HOPSCOTCH is introduced that is inspired by the popular childrens game. Two demonstrators of this concept have been realized and evaluated: HOPSCOTCH pad and HOPSCOTCH mobile . First results show a positive feedback from scholars and teachers. Finally, future directions for our research on HOPSCOTCH are described that could model research on exer-learning games as well as their application in the classroom.",NULL,NULL
719,"ROAD-MAP for Educational Simulations and Serious Games","An international research team from Canada, United States, and Hong Kong developed a novel solution for creating interoperable, scalable learning objects along a gradient from single interactive objects for one learning activity to articulations of thousands of learning objects that become simulations capable of automatically assessing complex conceptual and performance competencies. We call this solution R esearch O riented A daptive D ecision M odeling A rchitecture P latforms for Simulations  ROAD-MAP . Our acronym, ROAD-MAP , acknowledges the many pathways that can lead to developing educational simulations and serious games. Such pathways are not well-mapped at this time, especially in the context of how such simulations and games actually improve higher-order reasoning and pattern recognition. ROAD-MAP provides a generalized solution for building simulations and serious games within an evidence-based approach to design, development, and evaluation of new types of coupled research and teaching-learning-assessment environments for different discipline domains.",NULL,NULL
720,"Fostering Learning through the Use of Argumentative Serious Games","As broadly admitted in the related literature, argumentation can promote learning, teamwork and leadership skills. These skills are central to the future of both developed and developing countries; however, related work reveals that students have difficulties in creating logical arguments. Motivated by the above, this paper proposes an innovative learning technology that aims at supporting argumentation through the use of serious games. Serious games have been shown to engage and motivate users and can be built with limited resources in mind. We comment on the suitability of their features for argumentation purposes, and we discuss how their use on teaching argumentation can be beneficial.",NULL,NULL
721,"The Potential of Serious Games for Improving Health and Reducing Urban Health Inequalities","The area of serious games is a relatively new academic area of interest. There are rich pedagogically sound contexts for using serious games particularly when applied to healthcare. This paper begins with a brief review of how serious games can be used as an effective learning and communication medium before applying the constructs to an Urban Health (East Baltimore) context. The paper outlines how, in this context, games can be used as a pedagogical tool to foster superior learning and understanding, support improved patient health outcomes and help address urban health disparities.",NULL,NULL

The main focus is the design of serious games for oral health education for children and adults.",NULL,NULL
723,"Disaster Readiness through Education - Training Soft Skills to Crisis Units by Means of Serious Games in Virtual Environments","The training of soft skills in organizational settings has become very important for an effective communicative exchange between members of staff. Especially in companies where the line of communication has to be fast and unmistakable, e.g. in crisis management units, the regular training of communication skills is therefore indispensable. The DREAD-ED project proposes a technology-based teaching methodology to meet these needs. The methodology provides a serious game which enables its users to train soft skills in a virtual environment under safe conditions. The current paper presents the results of two trials conducted with crisis managers and university students.",NULL,NULL
724,"A Model to Develop Videogames for Orientation and Mobility","There is a real need to have systems for people with visual disabilities to be able to improve their orientation and mobility skills, and especially for children to be able to improve their autonomy into the future. However, these systems must be designed according to available objectives, methodologies and resources, as well as by taking the interests and ways of interacting of the end users into account. This work presents a model for the development of videogame-based applications, which includes differing levels of abstraction and different stages in the design and development of systems that allow for the improvement of orientation and mobility skills for people with visual disability. The feasibility of the model was studied by modeling two videogames for children with visual disabilities.",NULL,NULL

This framework is defined as the Levels of Interaction (LoI) approach. It is applicable to applications where the learner/player is immersed in a 3D virtual environment, interacting and exchanging knowledge with an adaptive crowd of conversational agents.",NULL,NULL
726,"Dose-Effect of Childrens Psychosocial Rehabilitation on the Daily Functioning of Youth with Serious Emotional Disturbance","Childrens psychosocial rehabilitation (CPSR) is a promising but under-evaluated home- and community-based treatment for children with serious emotional disturbance (SED). CPSR addresses the functional impairments of children with SED through an asset-based, skill-building approach that involves multiple systems in the childs life. The present study evaluated the effectiveness of CPSR by examining the relationship between the number of hours of CPSR received (dose) and changes in childrens daily functioning (effect). Data came from a retrospective review of medical charts at a site with a well-specified CPSR model. Trained raters assessed childrens functioning at intake and 4months post-intake using the Child and Adolescent Functional Assessment Scale or the Preschool and Early Childhood Functional Assessment Scale. After controlling for initial severity of impairment and receipt of concurrent psychotherapy and medication, regression analyses revealed children receiving larger doses of CPSR exhibited better daily functioning and had better odds of achieving clinically significant improvement than children receiving lower doses of CPSR. Findings suggest CPSR is a beneficial treatment for children with SED. Further study of this innovative treatment is warranted.",NULL,NULL
727,"Multimodal augmented reality tangible gaming","This paper presents tangible augmented reality gaming environment that can be used to enhance entertainment using a multimodal tracking interface. Players can interact using different combinations between a pinch glove, a Wiimote, a six-degrees-of-freedom tracker, through tangible ways as well as through I/O controls. Two tabletop augmented reality games have been designed and implemented including a racing game and a pile game. The goal of the augmented reality racing game is to start the car and move around the track without colliding with either the wall or the objects that exist in the gaming arena. Initial evaluation results showed that multimodal-based interaction games can be beneficial in gaming. Based on these results, an augmented reality pile game was implemented with goal of completing a circuit of pipes (from a starting point to an end point on a grid). Initial evaluation showed that tangible interaction is preferred to keyboard interaction and that tangible games are much more enjoyable.",NULL,NULL
728," SubSafe: a games-based training system for submarine safety and spatial awareness (Part 1)","Recent advances in hardware and software technologies for computer games have proved to be more than capable of delivering quite detailed virtual environments on PC platforms and gaming consoles for so-called serious applications, at a fraction of the cost than was the case 8years ago. SubSafe is a recent example of what can be achieved in part-task naval training applications using gaming technologies, exploiting freely available, freely distributable software. SubSafe is a proof-of-concept demonstrator that presents end users with an interactive, real-time three-dimensional model of part of a Trafalgar Class submarine. This Part 1 paper presents the background to the SubSafe project and outlines the experimental design for a pilot study being conducted between August 2008 and January 2009, in conjunction with the Royal Navys Submarine School in Devonport. The study is investigating knowledge transfer from the classroom to a real submarine environment (during week7 of the students Submarine Qualification Dry course), together with general usability and interactivity assessments. Part 2 of the paper (to be completed in early 2009) will present the results of these trials and consider future extensions of the research into other submarine training domains, including periscope ranging and look-interval assessment skills, survival systems deployment training and the planning and rehearsal of submersible rescue operations.",NULL,NULL
729,"Learning English through Serious Games Reflections on Teacher and Learner Performance","In this paper I shall discuss the potential of educational games (Serious Games) for teaching and learning English online focusing on user engagement, performance and design. The paper builds on data from a research project, Serious Games on a Global Market Place in which a platform for learning English as a foreign language in primary school (www.Mingoville.com) has been studied in the context of English as a foreign language in Denmark. On the basis of the initial research results from the project I am proposing that performance and engagement through Serious Games for language learning should be understood in the context of gaming and learning as both separate and interconnected processes. In this connection the mediating role of the teacher is particularly significant.",NULL,NULL

732,"Taking educational games seriously: using the RETAIN model to design endogenous fantasy into standalone educational games","We are witnessing a mad rush to pour educational content into games in an ad hoc manner in hopes that player/learners are motivated simply because the content is housed inside a game. A failure to base educational game design on well-established learning and instructional theories increases the risk of the game failing to meet its intended educational goals, and yielding students who are entertained but who have not acquired any academic skills or knowledge. Our review of standalone educational games has shown that they are not always based on sound educational principles and theories. We contend that, if academic learning is to take place, a new design paradigm must be developed. This article discusses the RETAIN design and evaluation model for educational games that was developed to aide in the evaluation of how well academic content is endogenously immersed and embedded within the games fantasy and story context, promoters transfer of knowledge, and encourages repetitive usage to that content becomes available for use in an automatic way.",NULL,NULL
733,"Enhancing Therapeutic Gains: Examination of Fidelity to the Model for the Intensive Mental Health Program","Given that the development of treatment fidelity assessment protocol is an integral but too frequently ignored aspect of clinical trials for psychological treatments, the Intensive Mental Health Program (IMHP) sought to build fidelity activities into training, program evaluation, and clinical recordkeeping from the outset of a 3year study period. We describe (a) operational definitions and measurement of the IMHP treatment model, (b) planned fidelity-promoting activities, (c) evaluation methods, and (d) fair to appreciable accomplishment of IMHP fidelity targets. Discussion of the circumstances and processes possibly hindering better fidelity for several IMHP treatment features accompanies presentation of fidelity data. We summarize pitfalls and compensatory strategies identified during IMHP program evaluation and offer practical suggestions to enhance accountability and evaluative activity in future clinical research.",NULL,NULL

The game was developed through a participatory design process involving therapists and children from the target user group. The game is implemented on top of a platform that supports the implementation of tangible user interfaces using sensing technology. We argue that physical interaction, motivated and constrained by the design of tangible interfaces, offers enormous potential for occupational and physical therapy where patients need to practice specific and repetitive movements.",NULL,NULL
736,"Naming Game An Automated Tool for Analyzing and Practicing Rapid Serial Naming on Dyslexic Persons","Most of the recent research on dyslexia agrees on that the speed of rapid serial naming (RSN) is an important correlate of reading acquisition. The reason for its importance lies in the fact that serial naming and reading depend partly on the same processes. Traditionally, rapid automatized naming (RAN) tests have been conducted manually without the help of computer programs. Because of the many limitations related to such method, we have developed a tool called Naming Game to automatize measurement and practicing of the rapid serial naming. Our aim is not only to create a versatile research tool for the researchers of RSN but also to offer an easy-to-use tool for health care professionals who need to carry out these kind of assessments.",NULL,NULL
